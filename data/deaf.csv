The upshot of it all is that he is cured of his worship of gold, tradition and lust of power chiefly by a blond second wife, to whom he had given $250,000, but who is deaf to his plea to let him have the money back as a loan for business purposes.And in the end there is the thor oughly subdued Brock Trumbull sitting in the sunshine with his grandchildren-surely a feeble finish.Mr. Bancroft gives a good perform ance, but it is acting that is wholly lacking in spontaneity. It is punctuated with artificial actions, acting without heart. When Mr. Bancroft taps his fingers on the arm of a sofa he does so as if he were timing every movement.There are some capital scenes in a shipyard, and here and there Mr. Cromwell has done something to relieve the labored piecing together of this triphammer type of tale.; injury as he has suffered, but that he cannot live through years of peace. He is always seen with his Great Dane, and the dog in the picture actually looks as though the actor were his master. He watches Elbing's every movement and will not leave his side. Elbing finally throws a bone down a flight of steps leading to his quarters. He then slams the door and one hears a pistol report and the dog leaps and barks at the closed door.There are some nice scenes between Mr. Baxter and Miss Hyams, butthere is an intrusive type of comedythat is more distressing than humorous.Besides the glimpse of Elbing and his dog and several other effectivestretches, Mr. Smith's wonderfulmake-up and his knowledgeful performance, there is the pleasing diction of Mr. Kirkland, who plays a EXPLORERS' TALKS WITH PICTURES earth, and each explorer describes the high-lights of his own expedition.
