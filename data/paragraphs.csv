Specifics for all the ills of life have been discovered daily and hourly; and if the public Press is to be taken as our guide -- for not a sheet issues from the Press but amongst the advertisements will be found the bold assertion of some loud proclaimer of his power -- unguents, liniments lotions and injections are all brought before the astonished world as possessing infallible power for curing the deaf. There is necromancy, witchcraft and marvelous power in everything he propounds. He has never been known to fail, according to his own assertion; and what chance has he who has devoted his life to inquiry, has honestly to confess that the deviations of nature surpass his expectations, that her ways are often Inscrutable, and all he can do is to study, to learn, and to attempt to cure, without professing that every malady is subjected to his superior skill?', 'First -- State of health; temperament; if any relations are deaf; duration of the affection; supposed cause; if it has increased by Hidden paroxysms or by imperceptible degrees; examination of the hearing distance; surface of the mcmbrana tympani; if air is heard, by means of the Otoscope, to enter the tympanic cavity; state of mucous membrane of the fauces; previous treatment; it discharge from ear; quantity and condition of the cerumen state of the dermis and osseous walls.', 'Patients who thought themselves completely incurable, have actually been examined by others who pronounced the cause of their deafness to be perforation of the tympanum. After a careful examination, I found the impediment to arise from a diminished supply of cerumen or wax, which caused a dry, rustling sound in the ear, particularly during mastication, as well as ringing noises in the head, unaccompanied by pain in the organ itself, but a dull sensation, and, extraordinary as it may appear, there was a total absence of noise when the atmosphere was clear; and, by exciting a due quantity of secretion, I restored their perfect hearing.', 'It often happens that the symptoms of deafness -- noises in the ears, &c. -- are present in two opposite cases, namely, when there is a redundancy of wax and a consequent impaction, and where there is a deficiency of wax, with or without a pathological change in the character of the [???]eramen. In this latter case syringing will cause mischief; indeed, many instances have come under my notice in which injury has been done by indiscriminate and prolonged use of the syringe.', 'Most urgently do I recommend those who are afflicted with deafness, however slight the impediment may seem, however easily it may be cured by an experienced aurist, never to have recourse to a syringe. They may be assured, though, there may be a vast number of instances in which no sad consequences has attended upon the syringing; yet there are so many and such serious, events which arise out of it, that no one who has regard for his hearing and for the comfort of not suffering from a noise in the head, should venture upon it. One sad termination outweighs a whole catalogue of fortunate escapes; for it has frequently happened that water forcibly thrown against the membrane, when unprotected by wax or a foreign body, has produced injurious effects which have been more or less lasting. The empirical syringing, the unscientific employment of tins frequently valuable remedy, has often excited acute disease in a predisposed tympanum, and has even induced fatal results. I therefore conceive it of more importance than any rules I may lay down; it is a maxim which I would have a starling taught to repeat; it is a sentence which should be repeated to everyone suffering from deafness or noises in the head; it is a voice which should be echoed on every occasion -- ""Be careful not to use the syringe to your ears!"" If, after such a warning, there should be any venturesome enough to neglect it, the danger be upon their own heads; but the repentance will come too late.', 'It would be ""misplaced here to allude to and describe the operation as I am in the habit of per forming it, in order to show its great practical value, not only in the treatment of partial deafness, but affording pretty certain means of restoring the hearing in the most obstinate deafness; I will therefore: postpone it to a chapter hereafter.', 'The celebrated Abbe CARTON, director of the Institute of the Deaf and Dumb of Brussels, to whom the instruction of the deaf and dumb owe so much, succeeded in developing to such a remarkable degree the intelligence of a poor girl, deaf, dumb, and blind, by merely placing his finger on the larynx of the unfortunate, that she could not only hear sounds, but distinguish everything that was said. It seemed as if nature wished to demonstrate that, by depriving her of so much, it still recompensed for all by a mere freak.', 'Medicine has hitherto had little or no share in the attempt of curing deafness; it has always been sounds and vibration, and nothing more. The celebrated ITARD tried no other means to restore hearing than by accustoming it to a succession of sounds from metal or wood; but our object is to accustom it to the human voice, in which all of these experiments have failed, and it has disheartened, at the end of a long practice, physicians who began with enthusiastic hopes. This shows that the hearing, an organ so delicate, an instrument so perfect, is a much better appreciator than all the acoustical instruments of the elements of sound and of the human voice. What we have to consider is the possibility of being able to reestablish the sense of hearing to such a degree as to be sufficient for the deaf to hear themselves and others speak, so that they may be able to enter into oral communication.', 'Mr. SAUNDERS, in his work entitled The Anatomy and the Diseases of the Ear, says: ""That the causes of the loss of hearing are involved in the greatest obscurity, and that we are almost destitute of information concerning the morbid changes to which the ear is liable;"" and in expressing the impossibility of curing any of the internal parts in the ear by manual operation, says: ""It by no means follows that such cases are irremediable many morbid changes of the vital organs of the body equally inscrutable as the ear in the living subject, are, when we know the symptoms indicating their existence, successfully treated by the operation of internal remedies; and I have no doubt that deafness, in various instances, depends on morbific changes, which are curable by the general treatment of the constitution.""', 'There can be no doubt that the different states of atmosphere act upon the organ of hearing when there is a preexisting disposition to disease, as there is a texture of infinite importance which assists in giving pliancy and elasticity, and which is an essential part of animal structure; this is the cellular substance. From the lowest grade of vegetable life we trace this tissue, consisting of cells formed of delicate membranes. The first genus of organic products is thus constituted, an aggregation of cells entering into the structure. It is the medium of communication between the vascular and the nervous system. Some of the German medical men have of late investigated this subject with peculiar ardor. It is on this that electricity has a wondrous influence, most particularly in damp weather, when we are constantly giving up the natural electricity of the system; for such is the tendency to a general equilibrium of caloric and electricity, that the ear is continually in a state of change of giving off or receiving them. Few things are more thrilling than the appearance of the large sparks of electric tire and the loud crack which occurs when you comb dry hair, more particularly that of females, in the dark. The peculiar blue light is singularly visible. A long train of fire seems to issue forth, and not unfrequently this is accompanied by a peculiar tingling sensation in the Auricle. Deaf persons particularly exhibit this phenomenon -- deaf females more especially; and there seems to be some connection between the deafness and the nervous system generally. We find such persons more than usually listless, given to yawning, and incapable of following any pursuit with vigor. They are liable to glandular swellings, and to attacks of inflammation of the tonsils, throat. Eustachian passages, and to cause a morbid condition of the mucous membranes of the throat and ear, also obstruction of the nose, showing what a sympathy exists in these different organs, singular as such effect may seem. Every medical practitioner, upon looking over his roll of patients, will find confirmation of it.', 'But the phenomena of the diseases of the ear are, as the inquirer into that branch of philosophy acknowledges, connected more or less with hygrometrical facts. In a work to which we have elsewhere alluded, as one from which most of the knowledge which Aurists have derived of diseases of the ear, is a very curious, and at the same time a remarkably well drawn up view of the effects of the atmosphere on the organ of hearing, exhibiting the influence of its pressure upon the system generally, and upon the ear particularly, being, as it is, continually exposed. The weight of atmosphere upon the human body is equal to TWO THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED AND SIXTY pounds, and therefore the pressure upon each square inch amounts to nearly nineteen pounds; if we then take the proportion of the ear, upon which the weight of the atmosphere is more or less increased, we shall find that there is, under certain circumstances, such increased pressure that the internal parts of this delicate organ must feel the full force. To those who have known what the simple exhaustion of a small quantity of air in a cupping glass effects as to the sensation of weight on the body, there can be but little difficulty in comprehending what changes may result front the weight of the atmospheric air upon the ear, and the effect that it has on the minute capillary vessels, and the small nervous febrilla, which exist to such an extent in the internal ear. This is a question, however, into which I have no inclination to enter; sufficient is it that those who are suffering from partial deafness only should be reminded that they ought to seek the means of relief which can be afforded them before they become totally deprived of hearing, as, according to the observations of ITARD, a certain number of deaf persons are not deprived of hearing, but only suffer from a feebleness of Audition, and that this natural feebleness becomes greater by reason of the total inaction of this sense, from whence results the natural demonstration that, in order to reestablish the energy of the ear, it is necessary for it to undergo a formal method of treatment. We have no hesitation, from our own experience, not only to con-firm what this great Aurist said, but we may add that there are many totally deaf persons who consider that not only is their case the worst, but give up all hope of ever receiving any benefit, and it often happens that they are the most easy cases for the restoration of hearing.', 'SURGICAL AND PRACTICAL OBSERVATIONS ON THE DISEASES OF THE EAR, WITH THE NEW MODE OF TREATING DEAFNESS.; TO WHICH IS ADDED AN APPENDIX.

A young man of twenty-four, named CASTELLAN, presented himself at the house of a respectable farmer named HUGUES, and pretending to be deaf and dumb, obtained supper and slight's lodging. In the morning he persuaded the farmer's daughter, a modest girl of twenty-six, to run away with him, and the indictment alleged that he obtained an irresistible influence over her entirely by means of magnetism. The moment she came to her senses she was filled with remorse, but whenever he magnetized her she was a mere instrument in his hands, and submitted to whatever he told her. Three doctors of Toulon gave their opinion in accordance with that of Dr. TARDIEU, of Paris, and many other medical men of the highest reputation, that it is possible by means of what is called magnetism to obtain such influence over a young girl as completely to annihilate her will. CASTELLAN boasted of his magnetic power while standing at the bar, and offered to magnetize the Presiding Judge. He actually tried to magnetize the Procureur-Imperial, and frightened him so much that he angrily ordered the prisoner to lower his eyes. Being found guilty by the jury he was sentenced to twelve years' imprisonment with hard labor.""]"

In this case, she (Amy Irving) is a deaf teacher who\'d like to dance, although other recent variations on this theme have dealt with a blind ice skater who\'d like to become a champion (Lynn-Holly Johnson in ""Ice Castles"") and an about-to-be-crippled ballerina who hopes to give one last great performance (Anne Ditchburn in ""Slow Dancing in the Big City"").In each of these movies — and ""Voices,"" which opens today at the Baronet, is about the best of a very lackluster bunch — the situation takes the place of a plot. His optimism and her infirmity are the only well-established signs of character, and the action creeps inexorably toward a happy ending that is at least as tired as it is triumphant. ""Voices"" is full of details about the young man, played by Michael Ontkean, and his family (three generations of contentious men) and their house (in Hoboken) and their business (dry cleaning). But it all manages to seem either trumped-up or extraneous, as does the fact that he has a dream, too. (He wants to be a rock singer.)Movies in this mold tend to be so preoccupied with pie-in-the-sky that they scant the everyday activities that might hold an audience\'s attention. (Perhaps the most powerful surprise in ""Coming Home"" was its matter-of-fact depiction of how a paraplegic might accomplish simple household or hygienic chores.)""Voices"" includes one very effective scene of Miss Irving conducting a telephone conversation — using a kind of typewriter keyboard — with a deaf friend, and it devotes some attention to sign language. But the director, Robert Markowitz, is so poorly equipped to render his deaf heroine\'s experience inventively that the best he can do is simply shut off the soundtrack from time to time. The screenplay, by John Herzfeld, is equally insensitive, particularly when it means to be funny. Someone in hero\'s family: ""Is she deaf and dumb?"" Hero: ""She is not dumb. She\'s smarter than all of us. She\'s a teacher.""Mr. Ontkean is considerably more likable than his material. But the character is so nebulous — and so noisy and frantic, as a clumsy counterpoint to the silent, demure heroine — that his performance never takes shape; ""Slap Shot,"" in which he was cast as a funny, disillusioned hockey player, provided a much better indication of what he can do.Miss Irving\'s role is just as ill-defined, but she is agile and interesting even when the screenplay merely calls for her to look shy. And in the last part of the film, when a frustrated and embarrassed Miss Irving — who has made a dramatically convenient secret of her deafness — auditions with a dance company, though she can\'t hear the music or the directions, she is given a welcome opportunity to be something other than an ingénue. She has an appealing uneasiness that might work better in less sugary roles.Alex Rocco, Herbert Berghof, Viveca Lindfors and the city of Hoboken also appear in the film, although only Hoboken accomplishes this with any success. Mr. Markowitz has also recruited some emphatically disagreeable bit players (one of them throws his false teeth on a table, to emphasize something he has been hollering about).And the script, which is mysteriously full of references to meat, is also overloaded with unlikely coincidences. Mr. Ontkean first spies Miss Irving, for instance, in a train station where she has been playing with one of those machines that engrave a name on a little good-luck charm, and tracks her down after she leaves the charm behind. Speaking of unlikely, her name is Rosemarie Lemon.""Voices"" is rated PG (""Parental Guidance Suggested""). It includes one very mild love scene and a little bit of angry language.', ""Screen: 'Voices,' a Deaf Teacher's Love Story:They Shall Overcome""]"

The rhythms of the sentences lead one to expect the patterned conclusiveness of fairy tales. Instead, one receives moments from stories whose endings can only be guessed. A deaf, dumb, blind child is visited by three enigmatic strangers and, for a brief space of pure happiness, hears, sees and cries out. And that is all. No ancient teller of tales could have broken off there, though ancient anecdotes were sometimes like this. ''Marvelous Things Heard,'' once spuriously attributed to Aristotle, speaks of one Demaratus who, unlike the boy in our story, became dumb for 10 days and afterward remembered that time as the happiest he had ever known. The Greek tale is less lyrical, altogether odder and, one must admit, sticks in the mind as Mr. Brown's does not. Similarly Mr. Brown's six pages about Genghis Khan's great-grandfather, who is turned back from his marauding path by a chance encounter with a shepherd, do not make an ordered story but could have been the matter, say, of an allusion in Dante. The story of the princess in the tower becomes, as one reads, the story of one who is herself turning into (mere) story - not just modern, this, but modernist.""]"

The Greek tale is less lyrical, altogether odder and, one must admit, sticks in themind as Mr. Brown's does not.

He who has once been deaf and has recovered his hearing, will best appreciate such an observation, and most particularly if he should belong to the class of individuals dependent entirely for their daily subsistence upon the hearing with which Nature has endowed them for their varied pursuits.', 'The object of my consideration is to point out the means by which the diseases of the Ear -- whether they are of a trifling or of an aggravated character -- may be avoided; for it would not be productive of benefit to the reader or to the surgeon simply to state what is to be done when the maladies are present, but to show what precautions may be taken to prevent their approach. The old adage -- ""Prevention is better than cure"" -- is as judicious as it is necessary; and if we cannot, from our habits of life, pay much attention to a fullness in the ear, or a little discharge or difficulty in hearing, we may nevertheless remember how much of good is to be derived from care and immediate attention, and how bitter is the suffering when the Hearing is entirely lost. Indeed, upon due observance and proper management of the organ of which we now treat depends, in a greater or less degree, the general health of the human body, and the integrity of all its different functions. By early attention it is easy to arrest those diseases of a chronic character whose progress toward a fatal termination is certain and inevitable, and from which there is but is slender chance of escape from being completely deaf. It is a theme which has occupied the pen of numerous writers, and given origin to a multitude of books. Indeed, the subject of treating Deafness seems to be almost inexhaustible. Theory is heaped on theory, doctrine upon doctrine; but we are too often apt to forget that experience and practice are far surer laws by which to be guided, than all the theory and all the doctrine that was ever preached.', 'It is a very curious circumstance that deafness is much more frequent in males than in females, which is in violation of the ordinary law, that, as the power of formation is weaker in the female foetus than in the male, so are the deficiencies more frequent. Mr. MAY, the director of the Deaf and Dumb School in Vienna, stated that the proportion of deaf boys to girls was as four to one. Congenital deafness does not appear to be hereditary, as most of the parents of deaf children have no defect of their organs, and it is a rare circumstance to meet a case of a deaf child who was the fruit of parents either one or both of whom were similarly afflicted. On the other hand, several children of one family will be thus affected without any known cause, while the others will remain perfectly healthy. KRAMER relates a singular instance of a man and his wife, of the name of HARTNESS, both of them healthy, and having no hereditary predisposition to any disease of the Ear in their family on either side, who have five daughters and six sons. The latter were all born deaf and dumb, while the daughters, without exception, heard perfectly well. This confirms what I before stand, that the more striking affections of the Ear seem to depend upon the greater constitutional vigor of the individual.', 'The symptoms of the severe affections which threaten and indeed are likely to result in complete deafness, are sometimes ushered in by a momentary pain in the ear, which is often neglected and regarded as being what is commonly called earache, and which may continue for a few hours, or may persist with occasional exacerbations for two or three days, when it more or less suddenly extends to the whole side of the head. In other cases the symptoms commence with hemicrania, or insupportable headache. The febrile excitement is most severe; the eyes are injected, watery, and intolerant of light; the countenance is flushed and anxious; the skin hot and dry; the pulse frequent and hard; the secretions suspended; the pain becomes excessive and extends throughout the whole head, but is more severe on the side affected, and the patient particularly refers as the most painful part, to the bottom of the Auditory canal. Sinnitus Aurium is a frequent distressing accompaniment. The pain is increased by noises, even the slightest, and by the movement of the jaw and attempts at deglutition. It frequently shoots through the brain, and extends to the fauces. The disease is attended by delirium, often very violent at the onset, but, toward the close, becoming low and muttering, and with occasional rigors. In its progress, the inflammation spreads to the mastoid process, which becomes hot and painful on pressure, as well as to the pharynx and tonsils, which are then tumified and reddened. The severity of the symptoms frequently abates in the morning, a reaccession often accompanied by rigors coming on in the evening. The patient is also deaf on the affected side.', 'So far, the symptoms, though indeed acute, are insufficient to distinguish inflammation of the tympanum from the most severe form of inflammation of any other portion. To perfect the diagnosis, it is necessary to ascertain that the Auditory canal is free from disease, and to take into consideration the longer interval of time between the first accession of pain and appearance of discharge. In external inflammation, the muco purulent secretion occurs in a few days, or even in a few hours. In the internal disease, a week or more will elapse before any matter is discovered, and then it escapes suddenly either through a rupture of the membrana tympani, through the Eustachian tubes, or through the ulcerated mastoid cells; whereas the external disease is preceded by a serous moisture, and the nervous apparatus which receives the sonorous undulations from the tympanum and conveys them to the brain -- one of the most delicate structures of the human body -- is liable to many functional and organic derangements. As some cases of Deafness, dependent upon the derangement of the nervous apparatus connected with the organ of Hearing, appears to be caused by the condition of the brain generally, or that part in intimate relation with the acoustic nerve, it would be very advantageous for the student that nervous diseases of the Ear should be divided into two classes -- to the first of which belong those cases where the special nervous apparatus of the organ is alone affected; the second, to those where the brain, conjointly with the Ear, seems to be injured. The first class may be subdivided into diseases arising from', 'Before describing any treatment to be pursued, I would urgently recommend to all sufferers from partial deafness to write down the conversation or reading of another person. It will decidedly assist the treatment of restoration to Hearing. Such a practice is better than merely listening, because it requires a more than ordinary degree of attention to bring the hand in obedience to the ear. Next to this should be the habit of listening carefully, for a few hours daily, to a person reading aloud. Remarks of this kind are very valuable to the Deaf. It is singular, therefore, that the idea should hitherto only have been noticed by writers on Aural Surgery in the most casual manner, if, indeed, we ran say it has been mentioned at all.', 'As a greater stimulus to encourage persons suffering from deafness to habits of greater attention, we may remark that nothing can be more painful to them than the gradual and final loss, one by one, of all the most familiar and pleasing sounds of nature. As the Hearing becomes gradually more feeble, the pattering of the rain, the rustling of the wind amongst the trees, the songs of birds, and the buzzing of insects, become more indistinct, or are altogether lost.', 'To a deaf person the air is always heavy and silent, and the earth as monotonously dull as all sounds are to the healthy hearing amid the falling of snow. If the Deafness be accompanied by tinnitus, as is often the case, the external silence is mocked by the continuous and tiresome noises produced by disease itself within the organ of Hearing.', 'SURGICAL AND PRACTICAL OBSERVATIONS; ON THE DISEASES OF THE EAR, WITH THE NEW MODE OF TREATING DEAFNESS TO WHICH IS ADDED AN APPENDIX.

There has been an average 140 pupils during the past year in the Asylum for Idiots, which was its full capacity; of these 123 were beneficiaries of the State.

My problem has been that paragraphs that seem to last as long as other writers’ chapters can suggest a kind of deafness and self-enclosure, or suit\xadcases into which you push every scrap you’ve ever collected, underwear and index cards spilling out the sides. These go a little oddly with a 24-page chapter (as in “Kissing the Mask”) on “What Is Grace?” Whenever I read about another of Vollmann’s earnest attempts to rescue a prostitute from the life she’s possibly chosen, I applaud his romantic hopefulness as much as I worry about his Quiet Americanism. And if any place would seem profoundly ill-suited to his hyper-wordy, over-the-top, madly indulgent approach — his love of gaucherie, uninflectedness and analytical filler — you’d think it would be the land of haiku and Noh plays. As they say around Kyoto, there’s a reason humans were given two ears and only one mouth.', 'Reader, I was wrong — in part. “Deaf, dumb and illiterate in Japanese,” as the author writes in his opening sentence, with customary cheerfulness and charm, Vollmann presents himself at the Noh performances of Nara and Tokyo as more or less a professional bungler, an “ape in a cage,” staring through binoculars at a startlingly esoteric and nuanced theatrical art of which, as he tells us (often), he cannot understand a word. His evocations of its death-haunted stories, its eerie masks, its male actors playing women, though occasionally gushy (Zeami, the 14th-century Noh theoretician, indicates “the infinite heights of beauty”), are so electric and strange, so enchanted, that they made me long for the very dramas that have often sent me toward the exit before the intermission. Best of all, he registers, and seems to relish, the contrast between Vollmannic effusions and a culture that speaks in pauses and implications, when it speaks at all. “Kabuki is the way that I so often write,” he offers, in one disarming confession; “Noh is how I would write if I were more ‘spiritual,’ more understated or perhaps just older.” The romance of the Other has rarely been so eagerly embraced.']"

BOERNSTEIN's command since about the 15th of June last. From the above notice, which I to-day have received from him, it will be seen that I have been authorized to open it again with certain restrictions prescribed by him on my official action. It is true that it is in the highest degree humiliating to any citizen of this State, and more especially to a public officer, elected by the free voters of the State, who has taken an oath to discharge faithfully his duty under the laws of the State, to be arrested and held by military power, required to take an oath unknown to any law of the land, or be held in custody, and finally to be obliged to discharge the duties of his office, if at all, under restrictions neither required or contemplated by the laws of the State. No one can feel a deeper, and more lasting sense of humiliation and wrong at these things, both as an officer and as a man, than I do. But notwithstanding all this, I believe the public good requires me, even under these restrictions, to enter on the discharge of my official duties. It is the end of the second quarter of the year, and the unfortunate inmates of the Lunatic Asylum, the Blind. Asylum and the Deaf and Dumb Asylum, are entitled to their respective appropriations, without which they must be thrown helpless and destitute on the charities of the world. The Penitentiary also would be compelled to suspend all its work, as all the guards and officers about it must leave, unless they receive their pay. Thousands are now suffering for their pay for services, provisions and other things furnished the Southwest expedition. A quarter's salary is now due every civil officer in the State, and the support of their families depends upon their receiving it. Hundreds of persons are now waiting to pay the taxes on their land before the time given them for this purpose expires, and it is advertised for sale. All these things depend upon the opening of my office. Besides, the payment of these several appropriations and demands will be the means of putting a large amount of money in circulation, which is more than ever before needed to relieve our overburdened people from the pecuniary distress which is now weighing them down. If the office be opened, this money is at once thrown out among the people, and may be the means of doing much good; otherwise it must lie idle in the treasury of the State, while thousands arc suffering for the want of it. These are some of the many reasons which have influenced me to the course I have taken in submitting quietly to an infringement on my rights as a citizen, and to an illegal and unwarrantable restriction of my action as an officer of the State. In submitting to these things, I desire to say that I have not in the slightest, degree either changed or surrendered my political opinions, which, in common with every citizen, I have the right to entertain and express.""]"

Mordant references to drugs pop up throughout the album: ''Fully loaded, deaf and dumb and done''; ''Gonna spend the day higher than high''; ''She shows no emotion at all/ stares into space like a dead China doll''; ''It's a chemical embrace that kicks you in the head.'' But as a poet of the seedy world, he's also above it, adding pinches of moralizing: ''Once I was you,'' he sings to a shooting-star in ''Independence Day,'' adding, ''Don't go too far/stay who you are . . . go to sleep and make the change/ I'll meet you here tomorrow.''""]"

And some remarkable feelings have flickered across that long, bony face, especially on the screen: ravenous loss as Olive in ''The Bostonians'' realizes that her adored protege has deserted her for a man; a weird blend of embarrassment, cynicism and self-contempt as, with an invisible twist of the lips, she encounters her would-be lover in ''Wetherby''; a scarcely credible mix of disbelief, grief, pity, pain, horror and despair as her Fania Fenelon copes with the impossible. Can you imagine watching children being dragged from their mothers to the gas ovens, or trying and failing to resist swallowing food provided by a collaborator, or being asked to comfort an S.S. officer who has become besotted with a little boy and then sent him to his death?

In accordance with that simplicity which marked the habits of the deceased, as it did those of his gallant brother, the conqueror of Scinde, the funeral was as plain as if it had been that of a simple tradesman, nothing but the number of carriages which composed the m???nful cortege indicating that the remains of England\'s greatest military historian, and one of her most gallant soldiers, were being borne to their last resting-place. Such is said to have been the wish expressed in the will made by Sir WILLIAM two years ago. The coffin was of plain oak, uncovered, and without even a nail to relieve its simplicity, and no sable plumes nodded above the hearse which bore it. Seven mourning coaches followed, and after these came ten private carriages. The procession left Scinde House, at Clapham, in the vicinity of the metropolis, at 11 o\'clock, and arrived at the cemetery a little after noon. The day was remarkably fine, but few strangers were assembled, and the whole number present, the mourners included, did not probably exceed fifty. The grave was an ordinary one, near the church, which is situated on the most elevated portion of the grounds; and no sermon was preached. Foremost among the mourners were the only son of the deceased, a fine youth, but who has the misfortune to be deaf and dumb; his daughters, and the husband of one of them, Col. MACHMURDO, who served under the late Sir CHARLES JAMES NAPIER, in Scinde, where, at the battle of Meanee, he clove a Beloochee chief to the middle; and Admiral Sir C. NAPIER, cousin to the deceased, and member for Southwark -- now the last of a trio of heroes. Among the spectators was a turbaned native of the East, who seemed to take much interest in the proceedings. Surprise at the unador???ed simplicity of the coffin and hearse seemed to be the predominant feeling among the onlookers, some contrasting it with the funeral of the Indian hero, who was buried at Portsmouth with military honors, and others observing that ere long the remains of the deceased would be exhumed, and interred in St. Paul\'s, as a tribute of respect from the British nation, at the expense of some of the foremost of whose public men there are two statues erected in London to ""the bearded vision that swept Scinde.""']"

In 1929, for various reasons - not the least of which was a failed love affair - Lorca sailed for New York, where he spent the better part of a year. His sense of constriction within the style he had previously cultivated comes through in a letter he wrote in 1927 to his friend Jose Antonio Rubio Sacristan: ''People confuse my life and character. And this is the last thing I want. The gypsies are nothing but a theme. . . . I just don't want them to pigeonhole me. I feel they are trying to chain me down.'' In ''Poet in New York'' we enter the elastic realm of the poetic sequence, stylistically varied yet carefully structured in its emotional dynamics. In the first poem, ''After a Walk,'' Lorca establishes what are to be some of the dominant tonalities in the book: With the amputated tree that doesn't sing and the child with the blank face of an egg. With the little animals whose skulls are cracked and the water, dressed in rags, but with dry feet. With all the bone-tired, deaf-and-dumb things and a butterfly drowned in the inkwell.""]"

Herein, the suave, silk-hatted comedian undertakes the rôle of a festive Coroner, who is not without personal prejudices when it comes to dealing with suspects. He thinks that a good-looking man might well have committed the crime, but when dealing with an attractive brunette, who is found with the jewels in her hand, he approaches the subject with due concern for the young person\'s sex and beauty. Hence, despite the sanguinary theme of this vehicle, the author, the director and the players prove their initial contention, for, judging by the hilarity of the audience yesterday afternoon, this particular murder mystery has few solemn moments.Robert Benchley, dramatic critic of Life, and Ralph Spence, who has helped many a film over the hurdles by his witty words, have lent no little support to this production by a series of bright captions, which are not only funny but thoroughly well suited to the action of the photoplay. During one sequence one is informed that a gracious young woman is ""more to be petted than scorned,"" and in another the Coroner goes up to the heroine and whispers to her:""Come, now, mayhap you committed the murder in a spirit of jest.""The police allude to the murder in terms that suit their respective rank. The patrolman speaks of the victim having been ""bumped off,"" the Sergeant talks of the man having been killed, while the Inspector characterizes the crime as an assassination.Aside from being a farce, this picture possesses more than a faint element of mystery. The Coroner, arrayed in evening clothes, does not forget to call attention to the fact that the day is Friday the 13th. He has his own fixed ideas concerning human psychology, and endeavors by various crafty methods to discover the guilty person. For instance, when he wants to ascertain which man is the husband of a certain woman he pulls out a pistol and digs it into the man\'s ribs, with the consequence that the suspect\'s wife rushes to her husband. He has other ideas, almost worthy of a Solomon, but in the end there comes a surprise.One of the humorous notions in this piece of work is the introduction of a deaf and dumb valet, with whom the Coroner, to the dismay of the police, is able to communicate by signs.By this type of feature Mr. Griffith opens up a new medium for his talent, for there is no reason why he should not appear in a series of productions burlesquing Sherlock Holmes and other famous fictional characters. Although there is a lot of nonsense in this current effort, it is pictured in a clever fashion and Mr. Griffith is in his element in this type of comedy.Earle Williams and Dorothy Sebastian lend creditable support to the featured player, and Arthur Rosson, the director, displays unusual skill in handling this subject, especially those scenes in which a number of players are grouped.

Those looking for spurts of comedy mingled with thrills will not be disappointed. This production is well photographed and the settings and exteriors please the eye.One might say that there is a touch of originality here and there in this photoplay, which is assuredly pleasing after the Summer or fine weather pictures that have been displayed recently. But suspense is shaken out of this production, as it is too light for anything like that. Miss Daniels at times devotes more attention to acting with her hands than with her pretty face, and in one scene she has with Antonio Moreno it looks very much as if a deaf-and-dumb couple were carrying on a conversation.Miss Daniels has the part of Ronnie Rand, who by the will of her late aunt must marry before she is 21 if she wishes to inherit a fortune. The aunt contends that Ronnie needs good advice from a husband.The opening of the production gives one an idea of the speed Ronnie loves. It is a picture of a speedometer marking fifty-five miles an hour, that being the rate at which Ronnie loves to drive her car. Ever bent on going through space as fast as possible. Ronnie is shown riding the surf behind a motor boat dashing along over the waves. She happens to be engaged to Roger Patton, whose idea of maximum speed is being pushed along in a wheel chair; and even with this halting movement he has trouble, for the absent-minded negro one bright morning shoves Roger and the chair over the end of the jetty into the water.Because the club is too slow for Ronnie, she speeds forth in an airplane to deliver unexpected packages of good things to the poor children, convenien???y staged on the beach. She is accompanied by an unwilling minister. They come down to a height of about 300 feet and drop the prizes with such accuracy that some of them fall into the laps of persons, while others are hit on the head with them. It gives one the idea that Ronnie, or Miss Daniels, ought to be a bomber in the flying forces. They meet with an accident, and Ronnie is badly hurt, and in a moment of semi-consciousness she remembers that she must get married that day. The only available man is a burglar who has rescued her from under the airplane\'s wing. The ceremony is performed, and soon afterward Ronnie offers the man a bribe for the marriage certificate, which he refuses. Roger appears to be relieved at the young woman\'s marriage.The burglar—Pierre Martel, played by Moreno—reports to his gang that he has a chance to wheedle great wealth out of the young heiress. There are fights, in some of which Strangler Louis is introduced. He has an obsession for choking people, and every necktie reminds him it is around a throat, and his thumbs always banker to press on a man\'s Adam\'s apple.As Ronnie gets well she walks around the boudoir, perfuming it with a spray, and then settles down on a chaise-longue, practicing with a pistol on a target ???ed to a tree. It is plain that she is recovering and that, if anything, she is rather proud of her burglar husband. Comes then the dénouement in which Pierre turns out to be a detective who has only been cracking safes to solidify himself with the crooks. Ronnie is chagrined at this discovery, looks upon it as deception, a detective meaning no thrill to this speed queen. But finally she settles down to the humdrum life of a detective\'s bride.Burr McIntosh does what he has to do as the family lawyer in a natural and pleasing way. Irvil Anderson as Strangler Louis loses no opportunity to show the strength of his fingers. Miss Daniels is always comely, and Moreno, when he employs expression instead of gesture, is quite convincing.There seems to be a dearth of plots in the Thomas H. Ince studios if ""A Man of Action,"" presented at the Strand this week, is any criterion of what they have on hand. But how this particular story came to pass the various experts in the Ince studios is one of those mysteries that perhaps never will be solved. James W. Horne directed this impossible production, banking probably on the good name of Douglas MacLean to carry it through. But it would take a genius, a young and accomplished Jekyll and Hyde, to do anything with this photoplay, alleged to be ""fast and funny"" and characterized as a mystery comedy.One would imagine that on a hot day Mr. Ince and the director were looking out of the window when this production was made, for, according to the scenario writer, all one has to do to carry out a daring deception is to go down to the Bowery, give half an hour\'s study to the type that makes horizontal gestures with his hands, and then return home as a burglar in a white sweater and persist that you are not yourself.MacLean has done good screen work, and he acts well in this contraption. He plays the Part of Bruce MacAllister, who has inherited a fortune in diamond mines, and therefore has all the comforts wealth can buy. He is waked in the morning by a timid servant, while another menial obtains the temperature of his bath water. So Bruce becomes a spoiled boy. Helen Sumner (Marguerite de la Motte) is disgusted with Bruce, and tells him that if ???e wishes to marry her he must be a man of action.Eugene Preston, who holds the reins of the MacAllister fortune, schemes to steal a box of diamonds worth half a million dollars, and he tells Bruce that he had better leave San Francisco and go East to attend an important meeting. Bruce agrees to accompany Helen\'s father, but he arranges with Dr. Sumner for somebody else to go with him, while he stays in San Francisco. So Bruce visits the underworld and falls in with the crooks with whom Preston is working on the big robbery. One of the band asks Bruce his name, and he replies ""Kid."" So of course they take him to be the famous ""Chicago Kid."" In a sweater and loose trousers, he returns to his home, where he convinces Preston, without further disguise, that he is not himself but the ""Chicago Kid,"" and obtains possession of the precious diamonds, but loses them soon afterward.Preston insists that everybody stay in the house until the gems are recovered, and the little box crops up in the hands of various persons, in scenes that are somewhat mindful of ""One Exciting Night.""Helen, surprised at seeing the house lighted up, calls in the police. She does not recognize Bruce. Everybody looking at the picture wonders why. He has not even let an eighth of an inch of stubble grow on his chin. And he is about to be locked up when Helen\'s father returns and explains that Bruce did not go with him. The real diamond thief turns out to be the ""Chicago Kid,"" who Just before the story opens had obtained work as a butler in the MacAllister home. Oh, yes! Then happy Helen announces to police, father and everybody that Bruce has become a man of action.It is not very often that one sees such a piece of nonsense as this, even in motion pictures, and why it should adorn the screen of the Strand is inexplicable.The cast is quite capable, Mr. MacLean is pleasing and Miss de la Motte does her best.Other Photo Plays.At the Capitol, ""The Ragged Edge,"" with Alfred Lunt, Mimi Palmeri and others.

Doe. He is the first black African leader to make a state visit to Israel in 12 years. The Liberian leader was said to have requested data on Libyan activities from Israeli intelligence. (A3:1-4.) A planned major sale to Libya has touched off a new conflict over trade policy within the Reagan Administration. A British-owned, Houston-based company seeks an export license to ship to Libya a $40 million offshore marine mooring system. Administration officials said the proposed sale was favored by Commerce Department aides and opposed by the State Department. (A1:1-2.)

Advocates of the new, highly computerized weapons systems say they could revolutionize conventional warfare by the year 2000 and could lessen the possibility of nuclear war by sharply increasing the nation's ability to win a war without using nuclear weapons. Other officials argue that weapons so complex would not be reliable and that such radical changes would weaken the military. (A1:4-5.)

Graduates of foreign medical schools are practicing where the graduates of American medical schools are reluctant to work. The physicians are generally concentrated in urban slums and in rural areas.

SON OF ZORRO, with Douglas Fairbanks, Mary Astor, Jack McDonald, Donald Crisp, Stella De Lanti, Warner Oland, Jean Hersholt, Albert MacQuarrie, Lottie Pickford Forrest, Charies Stevens, Tote Du Crow, Martha Franklin, Juliette Belanger, Roy Coulson and Enrique Acosta, based on the novel, ""Don Q\'s Love Story,"" by K. and Hesketh Prichard, directed by Donald Crisp; special prologue featuring Fred Lindsay in a demonstration of an Australian stock whip; musical accompaniment by Mortimer Wilson. At the Globe Theatre.It would be a blessing indeed to the screen if more pictures were produced along the lines of ""Siege,"" the present offering at the Capitol, which is an earnest and praiseworthy effort in the direction of true drama. This photoplay was adapted from Samuel Hopkins Adams\'s novel, and was directed by Svend Gade, who unquestionably received no little assistance in his task from the comprehensive scenario mapped out by Harvey Thew.This is not a flawless film, as there is an occasional tendency to exaggerate both in the posing of the players and in the scenic effects. The comedy touches are rather forced and the ending is flamboyant, with a leaning toward standardized conceptions. But the characters are forcefully drawn, and through that and the strict adherence to the theme ""Siege"" makes a strong impression. There have been many comedies produced with cunning and skill and also a number of satiric and fantastic films, but only too rarely does one see a worthy strong drama on the screen.In this current subject there is a good story which does not stray far from the bounds of probability, and for the most part the characters are human, especially Augusta Ruyland (Mary Alden), a widow, who is a dominant factor among the interests of a great factory and in the town. The portrayal of her iron will is admirably pictured, so well that one does not feel opposed to her even when she ejects Fredericka, wife of her nephew, Kenyon Ruyland. It strikes one that the old woman is selfish, but she has so much personality that she retains one\'s respect and to a certain extent one\'s sympathy.Aunt Augusta, as she is known, sits at board meetings, where her will is law, the other family stockholders being mere puppets who read and nod their acquiescence. She garbs herself as a Victorian and resents the invasion of some modern ideas. She goes to her business in a horse-drawn barouche, while her nephew and Fredericka speed along the highways in a fast automobile. Aunt Augusta turns over to her nephew and his bride an old home, many of the rooms of which denote the long period of vacancy by heavy lengths of cobwebs. This place is cleaned up and Fredericka so changes the aspect of the interior that she infuriates Aunt Augusta, who, although she admires cleanliness, objects to the new decorations and furnishings. Aunt Augusta has her spies and they report that Fredericka has been receiving daily great bouquets of roses from some anonymous person. Fredericka denies that she knows who is sending her the flowers, and Kenyon becomes jealous and his young wife leaves the great homestead.Norval Ruyland (Marc MeDermott), a nephew, who has been mute since birth, writes on a piece of paper that he has been sending the flowers to Fredericka, as she reminded him of a woman he loved. His admission is greeted with ridicule, and therefore he feels that he is partly responsible for Fredericka\'s unfortunate plight. One night he ends his life with a bullet, and leaves Fredericka his stock in the factory, which with Kenyon\'s gives the young couple the controlling interest in the business. There follow the surprise of the strong-willed elderly woman, and the way to a cheerful outcome of the misunderstandings.Miss Alden gives a splendid portrayal of Aunt Augusta, as she is strong but human, always ready to bend a little in favor of her own clan. She impresses everybody that she makes the wheels go round and that therefore they must do her bidding. Miss Alden registers the proper mood in all the scenes, but the director strains the effect when he makes Aunt Augusta take a standing pose in her carriage. It would have been more natural to have her delivering her opinion seated.Virginia Valli enacts the part of Fredericka. She is attractive, but frequently appears too cheerful immediately following dramatic and tragic situations. Obviously, she had forgotten what happened. Eugene O\'Brien gives a capable performance as the nephew, Kenyon.MR. McDermott, who since he impersonated a deaf and dumb paralytic in ""While New York Sleeps"" has furnished the screen with one or two deaf and dumb characterizations, is excellent as the mute nephew. He uses his eyes cleverly and creates much sympathy for the rôle. Mr. Gade pictures Norval\'s end in a deft, original way.This is a photodrama of unusual meri and one which we hope will lead other producers to appreciate the value of intensive characterization and a natural and plausible theme.']"

At the Paramount.A title like ""The Latest From Paris"" leads one to expect an adventure concerned chiefly with diaphanous periphery. This new Capitol presentation is nothing of the sort, for it is a sketchy idea of a romance between Ann Dolan and Joe Adams, both commercial travelers, who appear to spend most of their time in a place called Summerville. This is an inept tale with a style of humor that provokes anger rather than mirth. As the scenes pass on and off and one gets nearer the end one discovers that the most interesting feature of this film is the feathery studio snow that falls in Summerville.In one of the pathetic attempts to draw laughter, Mr. Adams, desirous of being alone with Ann on the observation end of the train, gets rid of some people by brief but forceful allusions to his recent attack of small-pox. In one instance this is ineffectual and he eventually discovers that the two intruders are deaf and dumb. Hence, after watching the men talking with their hands, he makes this bright remark:""If that man cut off a finger he\'d be tongue-tied.""Evidently the director and author of this yarn believe in a low level of intelligence, for the characterization is peculiar. Young Adams, a good-looking chap, who is the personification of persistence, has a long sulking fit because Ann does not agree with him in the matter of brothers. Then Ann, who has promised Adams her heart and hand after being furious with Adams, decides that the man she wishes to marry is right. So she returns to the benighted Summerville, where she hears that another girl is setting her cap at Adams.When Mr. Adams perceives Ann aboard a train going in the opposite direction to the one in which he is seated, he changes trains without troubling about his baggage. The climax of this adventurous study causes one to look upon the characters as clock-work automatons, wound up to go through their gestures and expressions according to the whim of the director, who is, perhaps, inspired by the weighty matter from the author. Ann is vivacious, it is true, but she evidently is not permitted to use her wits. As for Mr. Adams, he seems an object of sympathy, for apparently he has periods when none of his five senses is functioning.This specimen of Hollywood literature was furnished by A. P. Younger, and the picture was directed by Sam Wood. Norma Shearer does her best to make her part interesting, and Ralph Forbes, efficient actor though he is, obviously cannot fathom the weird character allotted to him.

The only advantage its occupation would give us above that of the occupation of any other port on that coast, would be such as might come from the navigation of the Savannah River to Augusta. But that navigation is long -- three hundred and forty-seven miles -- and difficult, and it is doubtful whether it could be kept open so as to serve any valuable purpose. It really is of no essential consequence whether SHERMAN finally makes his debouche at Savannah, or at Brunswich, or at Beaufort, or at any other harbor. It is enough that he can certainly, in his own good time, wind up his campaign at some point on the Atlantic, which will afford him a new base for subsequent operations. There is no reason why we should specially concern ourselves about his capture of Savannah. His chief work is already completed. He has completely severed all the Gulf States from the Atlantic States of the Confederacy -- as completely as the Trans-Mississippi States had been previously severed by our conquest of that river. The only two lines of railroad running eastward are so thoroughly broken up that the rebels could not put them in running order again for months, and probably never at all with their present scant resources. The miserable means of transportation on the miserable common roads can be of little or no account for military purposes. In a military point of view, the two great portions of the Confederacy are fatally sundered. The Richmond division can draw no supplies from the Montgomery division, nor can the latter be reinforced with troops from the former. All interior communication by telegraph is also destroyed, so that the Government at Richmond, in respect to its functions in the Gulf region, is not only paralyzed, but, for the present, at least, made deaf, dumb and blind.']"

That the occasion of such an election would always be one of peculiar interest. He would take the occasion to say that the election of a President was becoming more important every year. The patronage of this great officer was constantly increasing, and when he was installed he was clothed with more than regal power. No Chief Magistrate should be elected without careful consideration. The occasion was a more important one now, on account of the present issues before the people. The question was this: Should we continue to be the mere subjects of a minority, or should we resist it with the resolution of freemen? Never were the issues so important hi any previous canvass. We were told that if the people selected a magistrate by a due majority of votes, in strict accordance with constitutional principles, that the Union was to be dissolved and the country ruined. He need not tell them that this was one of the most insulting claims ever made, and involved a chance from a Republic to a vile oligarchy. [Applause.] He knew there were men among us that counseled submission, but had he lived at the time, he would have rather submitted to the claims of Great Britain, in the time of the Revolution, than to this infamous claim. Should it be submitted to? [Loud shouts of ""No!""] The majority was not to govern, but they were to go to favored section for a candidate that should be acceptable to that section! If they elected the man of their choice, fairly and in accordance with the Constitution, then the Government, they were told, was to be destroyed! He proclaimed the man a traitor who counselled submission to such principles. [Applause.] But he did not dwell on this now. He hailed from the Great West, and he must be permitted to say that that was a part of the country seldom politically heard about. The reason was that it constituted a sort of Empire in itself. There never was a man in that section yet that proclaimed that he would not be faithful to the United States Constitution. In population and in wealth that section towered immeasurably above the South. The great State that he came from alone, if put up at auction that day, would bring enough to buy two-thirds of the Southern States, -- and in making the estimate, they needn\'t count a free white man as more than half a negro. [Laughter and applause] Out there they heard of bickerings between the North and the South. Complaints from the South were coming up to them constantly. The Southerners were constantly talking about their rights. Why, did they ever talk of the rights of the West ? [Laughter.] Did they ever hear that the West had any rights? [Laughter.] Had she any at all? They, but there, heard threats of dissolving the Union. That great section stood vigilant and ready to defend the Constitution and the Union. [Applause.] Whenever any section of the country should attempt to put any of these threats into execution, it would find that it had aroused a sleeping lion in the path. [Great applause.] In the first place, he wanted to disabuse their minds of certain slanderous reports about the Republican Party. They were told that that great party which included to-day two-thirds of the people of the United States -- [applause] -- was sectional. He denied that such was the fact. [Applause.] He defied any gentleman to point out wherein the Republican Party trespassed on the rights of any section. If it was demonstrated that this was so, he would be the first to ask the Republicans to correct the error -- [applause] -- for it would be a great error. He maintained that no Government could or ought to stand on any platform but the rock of eternal justice. [Applause.] As the Republicans were about to take upon them the burden of the Government, for God\'s sake let them begin right, [applause,] and not founder where their predecessors had foundered. With no principle to guide them their opponents were become like the people that built the tower of Babel. They could not understand each other. In vindicating the party it might be necessary for him to go back to the history of parties for a few years. Would they bear with him? [""Yes!""] Somewhere about 1850, he need not tell them, consequent upon the acquisition of a vast territory from Mexico by the war, or rather by the peace that followed it, the question arose as to what should be the status of this Territory as far as regarded Slavery. It had caused the greatest excitement, and he need not tell them that the Southern people were wrong in the position which they occupied concerning it, and that the Northern people were right. But a compromise had been made. and he had never sought to break it, nor had they. The people of California met in Convention and knocked at the doors of Congress, seeking admission into the Union with a Free Constitution. Who was it that stood to keep her out? Was it a Black Republican? [Laughter.] Florida, Arkansas, Georgia and Alabama passed resolutions declaring that if that Territory was admitted it would be deemed cause for secession and dissolution of the Union. Where was the sectionalism then? He asked his Democratic friends what did he say to the Republicans of to-day? That the Republicans declared that they would not admit a Slave Territory. The Republicans had not said so; but the Democrats passed over this case of California. If the Free States had passed similar resolutions would not the Democrats have howled a little. [Laughter.] But Southern resolutions were admitted with all the submission of a sucking dove. [Laughter.] He put it to the Democrats, ought not California then to have been admitted? Here was little Texas, too, that had set up a claim to a vast territory, large enough for two or three States like New-York. What right had she to it? No more than a certain personage had to the world when he put it up for sale. [Laughter.] She was going to secede, too, unless we paid her $15,000,000, and we did pay it, for nothing but to pacify her. It was weakness on our part that had led to still more grasping claims. Had the North then met and repelled the base claim they would have had no more such claims to meet. [Applause.] But they had a weak man at the time for President -- might God forgive him (Mr. WADE) for voting for him. [Laughter.] Good old Gen. TAYLOR had met them by saying, ""Secede! I will hang every one of you, and use your own Southern troops in doing it."" Had Gen. TAYLOR lived that would have been the end of it. And what did the South do? It only consented that the slave-pens should be removed five miles from the seat of Government. That was all. And this was ""the Compromise!"" They (of the South) called it a compromise, when they never yielded a hair, and we yielded everything. The first Winter that he (Mr. WADE) took his seat in Congress, Mr. FOOTE brought up a resolution declaring that this Compromise should never be impaired. The Republicans -- there were some of the blackest of them there, then -- not one of them had opposed it. It was agreed that the Compromise should be final. It was a treaty of peace. The political conventions at the North had resolved that the Compromises should never be broken. And, now, who threw the sectional fire-brand? Was it the Black Republicans? Was there a Democrat here? [""No!""] Well, he was sorry, for he wanted him to look him in the face and tell him who broke the Compromise. They (the Democrats) threw the sectional firebrand. He spoke now of what happened when he was in Congress, a sentry on the watch-tower of the country; and he was neither deaf, dumb, nor blind, and he did know what happened before his eyes. Then a conspiracy, base as that of CATALINE, was entered into. A fusion was got up. [Laughter.] Honest men would not give up their principles, and therefore honest men could not fuse. The Northern Democrats and the Southern Democrats, and, he blushed to say, the Southern Whigs, concocted at midnight to rob the free laborer of his rights in the Territories. Had they read the speech of Mr. BELL, in which he denied that he had agreed to abide by this plan in caucus. He believed that good old JOHN BELL did not agree to this thing. Was there any excuse for this accursed treachery? Call themselves Democrats, and yet go and fuse to rob their constituents of what they bought! Well, Mr. DOUGLAS, without a petition or State resolutions, and behind the backs of the people, got up a scheme to rob the people of their rights. It came upon them like an earthquake. He wrote to his constituents and denounced them on the floor of Congress. A firebrand had been thrown into the heart of the country to vindicate a principle -- the principle of Squatter Sovereignty. DOUGLAS had carried two faces, one for the North, one for the South. He had said to the South: see, I have given a Territory larger than the State of New-York to the grasp of Slavery Make me President. But, thank God, the South were not to be gulled. They loved the treasure but despised the traitor. A man who had basely betrayed his own constituents, was not to be trusted with their interests. Of the humbug of Popular Sovereignty he would not say much, because it was an exploded humbug. His associates in the Senate ought to know DOUGLAS as well as you do, and they had removed their trust from him long since. Did you ever see an old hen scratching around with one chicken? DOUGLAS has but one chicken left and that chicken is PUGH. DOUGLAS claims to be a national candidate. A national man, without a single backer in the Senate! Would he not make a glorious President? But this was talking more about DOUGLAS than he deserved. When SWEDENBORG looked in the other world he saw gross material spirits that had been wandering for years, and had not found out they were dead. So DOUGLAS thought himself alive when politically he was just as dead as the ghosts of SWEDENBORG. [Laughter and applause.] DOUGLAS claims to be national because he can preach the same doctrine both North and South. This was merest sophistry. DOUGLAS might go to Mecca and worship MAHOMET, and they would say: ""Well done, good and faithful Turk."" He might return to this country and preach from his Koran, and the people would allow him to because he has a right to speak under the Constitution. So DOUGLAS might say: I am a world\'s man for I can preach my doctrine in Mecca and in New-York. He crawls on his belly when he goes South -- eats Southern dirt -- sings Southern base to their diabolical music. After thus humiliating himself, he comes here and boasts because he went South and was not kicked out. DOUGLAS says: ""I can visit my mother, while ABRAHAM LINCOLN cannot kneel by his grandfather\'s grave."" So the Saviour, nearly two thousand years ago, could not visit the place of his nativity, while Judas Iscariot could go anywhere in Jerusalem.']"

He could be very funny, “but that,” Daltrey comments ruefully, “was only about 20 percent of the time.

But the largest presence in “Thanks a Lot” — because it is almost an absence — is that of Pete Townshend. “The thing was,” writes the long-suffering Daltrey, “I recognized his talent.” In 1966, as part of a projected rock opera about gender reassignment called “Quads,” Townshend writes “I’m a Boy”: “I’m a boy, I’m a boy, but my ma won’t admit it.” “Bloody hell,” confesses Daltrey. “I found this very, very difficult.” In 1969, Townshend introduces “Tommy” to a preview audience as “a story about a boy who witnesses a murder and becomes deaf, dumb and blind. He is later raped by his uncle and gets turned on to LSD.” Incredibly, “Tommy” becomes a great success — and not incidentally another vehicle for the artistic emancipation of Roger Daltrey. “Everything I learned to do with my voice came from ‘Tommy.’ … I just changed.” However, 1971’s “Lifehouse” project, which features people in “experience suits” all linked up on a great “Grid” of leisure (hello?) — this is too much.

AVERY, a judge of the Court, were good enough to call to invite me to visit them, but I was obliged to decline. The old gentlemen were both members of the Home Guard, and drilled assiduously every evening. Of the 1,300 voters at Baton Rouge, more than 750 are already off to the wars, and another company is being formed to follow them. Mr. CONRAD has three sons in the field already. The waiter who served out drinks in the bar wore a uniform, and his musket lay in the corner among the brandy bottles. At night a patriotic meeting of citizen soldiery took place in the bow, in which song and whisky had much to do, so that sleep was difficult; but at 7 o\'clock on Wednesday morning the Mary T. came alongside, and soon afterwards bore me on to Natchez, through scenery which became wilder and less cultivated as she got upwards. Of the 1,500 steamers on the river not a tithe are now in employment, and the owners are in a bad way. It was late at night when the steamer arrived at Natchez, and next morning early I took shelter in another engineless steamer, which was thought to be a hotel byits owners. Old negress on board, however, said,""There was nothing for breakfast; go to Curry\'s on shore."" Walk up hill to Curry\'s -- a bar-room, a waiter and flies. ""Can I have any breakfast?"" ""No, Sir-ree; it\'s over half an hour ago."" ""Nothing to eat at all?"" ""No, Sir."" Can I get some anywhere else?"" ""I guess not."" It had been my belief that a man with money in his pocket could not starve in any country soi-disant civilized. Exceptions prove rules, but they are disagreeable things. I chewed the cud of fancy faute de mieux, and became the centre of attraction to citizens, from whose conversation I learned that this was ""JEFF. DAVIS\' fast-day."" Observed one, ""It quite puts me in mind of Sunday; all the stores closed."" Said another, ""We\'ll soon have Sunday every day, then, for I \'spect it won\'t be worth while for most shops to keep open any longer."" Natchez, a place of much trade and cotton export in the season, is now as dull -- let us say as Harwich without a regatta. But it is ultra-Secessionist, [???] obstante. My hunger was [???] by a friend who drove me up to his comfortable mansion through a country not unlike the wooded parts of Susser, abounding in fine trees, and in the only lawns and park-like fields I have yet seen in America. In the evening after dinner my host drove me over to visit a small encampment under a wealthy planter, who has raised, equipped and armed his company at his own expense.']"

nyt://article/95612395-6ddd-545d-b435-614258d9b31c,Success,"['""Deliverance,"" a screen life of Helen Keller, written by Francis Trevelyan Miller and directed by George Foster Platt, was presented last night at the Lyric Theatre.There is more in a ""life"" of Helen Keller than is dreamed of in any other life. It is a succession of wonders, of strange, mysterious, awe — inspiring things at which ordinary human beings can only marvel—and, perhaps, be stirred to greater endeavor in their own lives. It is such a life that the screen attempts to depict and its success is remarkable. With a cast of unusual excellence, with exceptionally good photography by Arthur Todd and Lawrence Fowler, and with one of the most wonderful stories in the world, ""Deliverance"" is one of the triumphs of the motion picture.The story is divided into three acts, or chapters. The first is about the child Helen, deaf, dumb, and blind, a little wild animal raging in a strange world until her famous teacher, Anne Sullivan, comes to bring knowledge and understanding slowly into her life. This is, perhaps, the most appealing and at the same time the most amazing part of the story, for it shows in eloquent moving pictures how the process of instruction was begun and how it progressed. At first there is the tedious spelling of ""water"" by Miss Sullivan\'s pressing her fingers in the palm of Helen\'s hand, and then other words follow until deliverance has really begun—Helen can communicate with her fellow creatures.The second wonder follows after a long struggle in which the child\'s passionate eagerness to learn is seen in everything she does—Helen learns to talk. The effect of the picture on the spectators may be indicated by the fact that when she was represented as saying ""I am not dumb now,"" the house broke into spontaneous applause. A number of times while the picture was being shown there were such outbursts, showing that the story, as a narrative, was holding and stirring those watching the screen.In the first part the rôle of Helen is played by Edna Ross, a child of truly unusual talent, and others in the cast, including Tula Bell as little Nadja, Edythe Lyle as Miss Sullivan, Betty Schade as Mrs. Keller, Jenny Lind as Pickaninny Martha Washington, and Sarah Lind as an Old Mammy, make their characters live.In the second part Ann Mason appears as Helen Keller, the young woman, and she matches the performance of little Etna Ross. This part shows the continued growth of Miss Keller\'s mind and the development of her accomplishments. In the third, and last part, Miss Keller herself appears, and with her Miss Sullivan, now Mrs. Macy; Mrs. Kate Adams Keller, her mother; Phillips Brooks Keller, her brother; Polly Thompson, her secretary; Ardita Mellinina, as Nadja, and Parke Jones as Nadja\'s son. Helen Keller\'s life today is pictured. She is seen at her work, at her dreams, at her play, and her message of courage and faith is emphasized by quotations from her writings and symbolical scenes. The story ends with the woman seeking to bring deliverance to a blind world, and in the possibilities of which she has unshakable faith.All through the photoplay there is symbolism, and some of it is impressive and peculiar to the power of motion pictures. And, let it be repeated, the story, as a story, grips and holds the interest as few photo stories do. In places it is overburdened with moralizing, and its optimism is sometimes spread too thickly, but throughout its main course it is compelling.Dr. Anselm Goetzl has arranged an excellent musical accompaniment for the picture and conducts the orchestra.Miss Keller originally intended to appear last night in person, but when she learned that the actors were striking against the Shuberts, who own the Lyric, she declined to come to the theatre.""The Mother and the Law,"" which is the somewhat amplified modern version of D. W. Griffith\'s ""Intolerance,"" was presented at the George M. Cohan Theatre last night as the fourth offering of the Griffith repertory season.In this picture, as those who saw ""Intolerance"" will recall, Mr. Griffith turns his camera on social conditions. He uses the method of the story, and his story has the elements of popular appeal, but it is not told for the sake of its telling; its purpose is to present a cross-section of life at different levels and to show how the life on any level is related as cause or effect to that on another. In order to deal with individuals, it was necessary, of course, for Mr. Griffith to isolate human beings and their experiences, and he was not able to cover the whole social field, but he took cases sufficiently typical to be true, and based his story on the fundamental truth that human selfishness, blindness, and intolerance are the prime cause of human misery.The principal figures of the story are in one of two groups, that of the smug social uplifters whose ""charity"" is financed by an ""industrial overlord,"" and that of the mill workers who are the victims of the vicious charity and the overlord\'s oppression. As the success of the uplifters increases, as measured by dance halls closed and babies ""rescued"" from ""unfit"" mothers, the suffering and degradation of the people on the lower and ever-lowering level increases correspondingly. And playing their destructive part are intolerant laws, political corruption, and man\'s inhumanity to man as revealed in many ways.In driving home his facts Mr. Griffith used dramatic strategy and screen technique. By cutting in and back, as may be done only on the screen, he brought contrasting scenes together to emphasize the tragedy and bitter irony of their relation, and never before has the close-up been more effectively used to focus attention on little things big with meaning. ""The Mother and the Law"" is distinctly a motion picture.Chief among those in the cast, not only by her name, but by her performance, is Mae Marsh. As the little girl who becomes the woman and the mother, she is the centre, and the most appealing victim, of the story. Miss Marsh is reported to be enjoying now a happy home and family of her own, and for this all are glad, but, at the same time, one cannot be blamed for hoping that she will find a way to come back to the screen. Miriam Cooper is in the cast, and gives a noteworthy performance, as does Robert Harron also. Walter Long, Vera Lewis and others make their roôles realistic.The nature of ""The Mother and the Law"" has been only suggested, and what has been said is perhaps unfair to the story, from the point of view of those who want a story first of all. The film is not simply a preachment. It is dramatic, at times theatrical, in its narrative, and may be criticised, in fact, for being too melodramatic in its last reel. For the sake of those to whom the characters are just screen folk it has ""a happy ending,"" but it is a tragedy nevertheless, and its real ending is on the fact that the conditions pictured still continue—and the unhappiness of this cannot be put out of the mind by the purely accidental good fortune of the hero and heroine.William Fox\'s screen versions of ""Evangeline"" and ""Kathleen Mavourneen"" will be presented at the Forty-fourth Street Theatre this evening, the strike permitting.']"

Indian affairs are reviewed at length, and the setting apart of new and larger reservations is urged; the Pension Bureau is rapidly increasing in its number of pensioners, which now reach 13,659 from the army, and 1,132 from the navy, requiring an annual outlay of fully $1,500,000 per annum; the Patent Office has issued nearly four thousand patents during the past year; the Government Asylum for the Insane has greatly enlarged its sphere of usefulness by affording a refuge for many of the unfortunates of the war, and the Institution for the Deaf, Dumb and Blind has been managed with great success; good progress has been made on the Capitol extension, and nearly all the works of art designed to embellish the Capitol building have been completed and put in their places.

As soon as the royal visitors were seated near the stage, Mr. HARVEY P. PEET, the Principal, addressed the Prince as follows:"", ""From the length and breadth of our land has rolled one glad acclaim of welcome to the Heir of England and the son of her peerless Queen; and though we may not join our voices in the glad roll of sound, our pleasure is not the less heartfelt, nor our welcome the less warm to him to whom the world looks as the future ruler of its mightiest nation, and the proud retinue of England and America's noblemen who accompany him here to-day. Others have expressed far better than it is given us to do, the objects of our Institution, and the degree of success which has attended those who, in imitation of their Divine Master, have sought to give ears to the deaf and a tongue to the voiceless."", 'While they were writing these, Miss GERTRUDE WALTER, of this City, delivered by gesture the beautiful poem given below, composed in honor of the occasion by Mrs. H.L.

It is a conventional yarn studded with conventional episodes, and Miss Moore, who impersonates Berenice Summers, not only indulges in gestures as if some of the characters were deaf and dumb, but she also is supposed to do everything but turn handsprings without attracting undue attention.It is time that Miss Moore\'s talent was employed in some really well-written comedy. This present offering has the nice little girl whose uncle has struck oil in Texas. She comes to a finishing school where her appearance is not exactly the last word in looks or dress. You rather anticipate that Berenice is soon going to discover a means to make herself attractive, and she does. The first essential appears to be to throw away her horn-rimmed spectacles, and the second is to have her hair trimmed a la Colleen Moore. It is, therefore, not surprising that a young man who does not realize that beauty is only skin deep finds Berenice, the girl he had once snubbed, absolutely enchanting.Berenice assuredly has her full share of excitement in this picture, and it is all a matter of opinion as to whether what she goes through is funny or not. There is one scene, for instance, where Berenice and a chum are confronted by the Principal of the school they are attending. The two girls are asked to explain their presence in a Washington hotel This leads to highly improbable incidents and amazing coincidences. In the hotel elevator with the school Principal, Berenice performs the startling feat of signaling to Paul Carroll and having her arm almost shut in the door of the elevator, without the severe Miss Perkins noticing what has happened. And this is not an isolated instance of the strange attacks of abstraction of some of this film\'s personalities.Berenice, who is apt to tell untruths to escape from an awkward predicament, eventually has to pose as the wife of a man she had never seen up to that moment. And this amiable soul, Paul Ames, is supposed to be quite an authority on political information, which causes one to reflect that he must have had considerable influence to get him where he is. Mr. Ames, who consents to jeopardize his career without even being interested either in Berenice or her friend, is so deeply engrossed during one spell of this affair that he puts on his trousers backward, even to fastening the suspenders. But one has to remember that these characters live in another world. They are the crude creatures of picture directors, with sawdust in their veins, frequently in dressing gowns, always well shaved and beautifully barbered, with an ear for naught else but the voice of the director through his sawed-off megaphone.Occasional peals of feminine laughter greeted periods of this effusion. It was, however, interesting and pleasing to observe that when Charlie Chaplin\'s old comedy. ""The Immigrant."" was projected, not only was the feminine laughter far more enthusiastic, but the less musical laughter of men joined loudly in the chorus. This Chaplin two-reeler may be old, but it still has some good moments, especially when Chaplin takes another man\'s tip to pay for his lunch and then gives the waiter a dime, while the generous individual is frowned upon by the white-aproned menial.""The Immigrant"" gives Chaplin an opportunity to reveal something of the agony of mal de mer, not abruptly, but gradually. Chaplin is perceived scoffing at others who are not able to suffer the roll of the vessel, and then to his utter astonishment he finds that he himself is not immune.']"

After some routine business, a letter was read from Hon. CHARLES F. ADAMS, the American Minister to England, and a map exhibited, which he presented to the society. The map is known as ""Mitchell\'s Map,"" was made in 1755, and is the only one of the kind in this country. It is the one upon which the boundary question between the United States and Great Britain was settled. After some further business, the President introduced Mr. F.B. HOUGH, Superintendent of the State Census of 1855, who read a historical sketch of the census in New-York, and a statement of the plan of the census to be taken in this State during the present year. He commenced with a review of the census in colonial times, mentioned the alterations and improvements made since, the introduction of Agricultural Statistics in 1821, the great improvement made in 1850 of giving the name of each person; said that in 1855 the State had adopted the Federal system of taking the census, with additional columns for the material and value of dwellings. The census was then arranged by the Secretary of State and Marshals appointed by him to the number of 1,744, it being the intention to appoint one to each election district. That law is still in existence, and that will be the basis of the coming census, except that large election districts will be subdivided. Each enumerator in the country will have a population of about 2,000 persons, and in the city about 3,000. To do this it will be necessary to appoint about 2,500 enumerators. The most serious obstacle which lies in the way of taking a full census, is, that by many it is believed to be in some way connected with military matters or with taxation. The only remedy for this is an official statement that it is required by the State law, under the constitution, and that it has no connection in any way with either of these matters; and in order to relieve the collectors of information from all, even seeming, connection with draft or taxation, they will be called Enumerators instead of Marshals. The principal improvements recommended in 1865 are as follows: The ages of persons under five years of age will be reported by months; the place of employment, if different from the residence of the family; a separate table of information concerning deaf, dumb, blind, idiots, &c., and all facts connected with them; an inquiry as to all who are now or have been in the army or navy, their original position, promotions and present positions, or if they have left the service, whether wounded, sick, or in what condition; the statistics of marriage, same as in 1855, except that the names of both parties will be given, and how the ceremony was performed, whether by a clergyman or by civil authorities; death statistics, same as in 1855, except to give name of party deceased; agricultural statistics same as in 1855, except that in each crop, the number of acres planted the previous year and now in crop, will be inquired into, and the yield of the present year; a special inquiry will be made regarding epidemics among domestic animals; the manufacturing statistics will be given the same as in 1855, except that particular blanks will be given for great manufacturers, and particular blanks will be given, also, for all institutions, orphan asylums, &c. At the conclusion of the lecture, a vote of thanks was passed to Mr. HOUGH, and a request for a copy of the paper, to be deposited in the archives of the society, alter which the meeting adjourned.']"

The contingent required for recruiting the ranks of the army is fixed annually by Imperial decree. It varies according to the exigencies of the times and the prospects of peace or war, but it may be stated at an average that in peace the proportion is one soldier to every ninety-three of the population; in war, one out of every fifty-nine. When the amount of the annual contingent has been fixed, the supply of conscripts from each canton is regulated by the number of names inscribed in the Liste du Tirage, and the burden of the conscription is thus borne by the whole community. Eugene, the son of M. le Marquis, is as liable to serve on completing his twenty-first year, as Francois, the son of his laboureur, on attaining the same age, to St. Cyr or to the Ecole Polytechnique, and then he will take his rank in due time as an officer; or may pay £92 into the Caisse de la Dotation de l'Armee, in which case he will be exempted from service. It is not to be supposed, however, that all the conscripts whose names are inscribed in the Liste du Tirage will be compelled to serve. More than half the number are always exempted on different grounds. We find, for example, that in one year the number of names inscribed amounted to upward of 300,000, while the contingent was fixed at 140,000. The number mentioned in the contingent is always higher than that actually required, as a certain allowance has to be made for necessary deductions. In this particular year, the total number of new recruits available for active service amounted only to 105,388, instead of 140,000; it is interesting to examine the different grounds on which more than 200,000 men, in the very prime and vigor of their manhood, obtained exemption from the toils of military duty. NAPOLEON III. has not the same passion for gigantic soldiers as FREDERICK WILLIAM of Prussia. He knows that the soul of a hero may be encased in the body of a Zaccheus. He knows, moreover, that 60,000 tall men could not be collected from a race who have degenerated physically in consequence of the wars of the Empire. He has, therefore, wisely fixed the standard height for regiments of the line at five feet one inch. No less than 18,000 conscripts were rejected because they fell short of this height; and we can conceive the mortification of some and the joy of others on finding that their diminutive stature reduced them to the status of civilians. About 40,000 were exempted on account of family circumstances, by which we are to understand that they were the principal support of their parents or others, who, without them, would be dependent on the public for support. More than 60,000 were rejected as physically unfit for service; and it is somewhat singular that this number is almost identical with the proportion of rejections among British recruits at the primary inspections. It must be borne in mind, however, that the minimum height of a British recruit is five feet four inches, and that the active, nimble fellows of five feet one inch, who are deemed eligible for service in France, would be at once rejected in England. The French classification of those physically unfit for service comprises many who would never dream of presenting themselves to the recruiting sergeant. The French youth of twenty-one years of age may be lame or blind, deaf or dumb -- nay, he may be laboring under all the infirmities that flesh is heir to; notwithstanding all this, his name will assuredly be inserted in the Liste du Tirage, and he will have to pass a medical examination before he is finally rejected.""]"

In that respect, we should be liberal with those less fortunate than ourselves. Was a man deaf or dumb he was set apart for some capacity.

There had been much trouble about the Trinity and other religious matters, but of all the fantastic imaginations, there had not been such a strain upon humanity as these Africans in America. [Laughter.] They had been such a great strain upon the Christianity of the South that they had destroyed it. [Applause.] He repudiated the Christianity of the slave plantation. [Applause.] Four millions of men had been the test of Christianity in the South. Now, our time had come. Now, God said, let us see what your Christianity is. Some talk had been made upon the subject, and God said, let us see if you believe what you have been saying. God had placed the responsibility upon us. Concerning the education of the blacks, it was true there were some hindrances, but we should not avoid the subject. There had been a disinclination to meddle with it because it was disagreeable. There was always a choice between disagreeable things. It was disagreeable to be a baby, and more disagreeable to take care of one. [Laughter.] A great many were tired of the negro, and for himself, he would say he was. [Laughter.] Many had asked him when we were going to be done with him. According to the statistics he did not see that they were going to be done with him immediately. [Laughter.] He would leave that question for the Creator to answer, and if they did not like it, he would say, what are you going to do about it? The negro was a continental fact, and they could not get around it. The only thing was would they treat him like a brute or a man. [Applause.] There were men who asserted that the negro was made for Slavery, and that he should be taken back to bondage. Then why don\'t they take him back? Why do they let him hang between Freedom and Slavery? He would be glad to have a man who says a negro is only fit for a slave, put alongside of a black man at work, and if the latter did not beat the white grumbler in every attribute, and not more than half work to do it, he would be very much mistaken. The issue had to be met. He would say that the African was born immortal; he did not have a black heart. His organization made him a man. God would bring down his wrath upon the nation until His despised were cared for by us. Mr. BEECHER argued that the black man should have a fair opportunity to test the abilities God had given him. Mr. BEECHER conjured his hearers to practice their religious and political faith toward the black men. The negro was entitled to the application of the laws of religious and political manhood. They had been praying to God. ""Thy will be done."" Were they prepared to go on praying? He believed in Christianity even when it obliged him to accept the tremendous responsibility of five millions of Africans. If the American people accepted that Divine trust there would be an era of piety never before seen. Give every man his liberty and his rights. Clothe the black man, feed him, educate him, and then, whatever new relations may come, would devolve upon those who come after us, and God would provide for all the rest.']"

Young Tommy then goes on to become the pinball champ of the world and, eventually, after he miraculously regains his senses, the new messiah who preaches salvation through pinball playing.Mr. Russell\'s style, which had the effect of literalizing the artistic impulse in ""The Music Lovers"" and ""The Savage Messiah,"" seems to liberate Mr. Townshend\'s rock score and lyrics, which are sometimes in embarrassingly dead earnest.""Tommy"" is composed of excesses. Bad jokes or heavy-handed satire are redeemed by everyone—director, production designer, orchestrators, actors—going too far, which is, after all, what the original ""Tommy"" is all about: a world inhabited by people too jaded to react to anything but overdoses.The performers are extravagantly fine, particularly Ann-Margret who, as Tommy\'s mother, ages 20 years in the course of the film (largely through the increased application of blue eye shadow) and sings and dances as if the fate of Western civilization depended upon it. She is tough, vulgar, witty and game. The Who\'s lead singer, Roger Daltrey, plays the grown-up Tommy with a drive that matches Ann-Margret\'s while successfully simulating show biz innocence. Oliver Reed is, correctly, almost a cartoon as the opportunistic stepdad. He also sings quite nicely.The movie, which has the structure of a vaudeville show, is laced together with specialty bits, some of which are simply jokes (Jack Nicholson playing a vacuous Harley Street medical specialist) and some of which are production numbers as riveting as rock can be at its best. These include a sequence in which Tina Turner shows up as The Acid Queen who attempts to cure the catatonic Tommy, and others with Elton John, as the Pinball Wizard defeated by Tommy, and Eric Clapton, as the Preacher who presides over a Lourdes-like shrine devoted to the healing powers of St. Marilyn (Monroe).As I said, it\'s all fairly excessive and far from subtle, but in this case good taste would have been wildly inappropriate and a fearful drag.']"

One lady, indeed, startled the Prince into expressing opinions, by regretting for him the unhappy fate which had compelled him to travel through the United States without sharing in a railway accident, and by explaining to him that if American ladies lay aside their bouquets when they waltz, it is from their considerate anxiety ""not to tickle their partner\'s ears.""

The film came yesterday to the Palace with the vaudeville bill.Those familiar with Mr. Redgrave and his customarily rigid acting style may not even recognize him in this elaborately eccentric role, and that may be just as fortunate—at least for Mr. Redgrave\'s repute. For his crafty old fuddy-duddy becomes quite a trial himself, with his flamboyant courtroom performance, before the trial in progress is done.This is to be regretted, since Mr. Redgrave\'s behavior takes the mind away from an interesting mystery involving an accused man who is deaf, mute and blind. And this poor chap, locked in eerie silence and decently played by Kieron Moore, is the most intriguing figure in the picture. No wonder Mr. Redgrave works so hard.It is the accused, whose afflictions have been with him since birth and whose marriage to a childhood companion has for some mysterious reason gone awry, who commands the audience\'s interest, curiosity and sympathy. He is the point of concentration for what freshness there is in this court-room film. And the pictorial explanation of his background and the visual probing of the crime for which he is arraigned constitute an absorbing study and a teasing uncertainty.In the performance of these things, Ann Todd is taut and wistful as the wife and Leo Genn is quietly impressive as the long-time tutor of the afflicted man. Beside their rather solemn persistence in pursuing a serious theme, Mr. Redgrave\'s eccentric play-acting seems more than a little out of tune.Director George More O\'Ferrall may have felt he was getting variety this way, but the effect is oddly provoking. Mr. Redgrave is less a character than a clown. As a consequence, ""The Green Scarf"" is a mottled and unconvincing thing.']"

He is dealing with Junpei, a seemingly money-grubbing, but happy-go-lucky wanderer, who has his belongings stashed all over his person, including 80,000 yen, as well as in hiding places all over the countryside.His carefree existence, however, is constantly jeopardized. Picked up by the cops for refusing to pay a restaurant bill, he runs into a comely lass, Komako, also an itinerant, whose racket is claiming to be a victim of the A-bomb. Love, apparently, is in the air but, before you know it, our heroine has skipped with his money and our hapless hero is on the road again seeking the light-fingered lass.Coincidence, it should be pointed out, is an auspicious ingredient of the plot, for at this point, he is saddled with a young brother and sister, foundlings suddenly left with him by their foster mother. Mr. Matsuyama\'s script may not be noted for its rational approach, but it does give his small cast a chance to move around in a lovely countryside, which is captured in beautiful colors. There are wandering streams, a religious festival set against a striking, shimmering waterfall, as well as picturesque views of Osaka, Tokyo and the vivid, rural terrain in between.Junpei\'s travels find him drawn more and more to his frolicking charges. He forthrightly begs and borrows and plays with them to give them the paternal protection and affection they need. He is gruff but appreciative. And, he is man enough to park them for an hour or so to catch a strip-tease act in a small town music hall. One of the kids becomes sick and, as mentioned before, his lady love, who is given to remarking on the absence of peace despite negotiations between the United States and Soviet Russia on atom-bomb tests, turns up to take care of her. She, it appears, has saved his money and wants him to marry her.It is not that simple, of course. Mr. Matsuyama\'s saga is convoluted even though his happy ending has all four bright, clean and ready to face a commonplace but contented family future together. His comedy is obvious and rudimentary but his affection is genuine and universal. His philosophy, on the other hand, is basically cynical. The war made some people shy from the good, old verities and they became hard and opportunistic. And, the threat of another bomb obviously has done little to lighten their burden.As the hobo of the title, Keiji Kobayashi, and his lady fair, played by the beautiful Hideko Takamine, one of Japan\'s top actresses and the wife of the director, are a direct and engaging couple. Since they appeared together in ""Happiness of Us Alone,"" they give a realistic impression of complementing each other and enjoying the roles of friendly enemies who eventually discover their mutual need for the standard life. The little brother and sister, Norehei Miki and Reiko Dan, are endearing youngsters, natural, cute and properly inquisitive and rambunctious. Like them, ""My Hobo"" is charming, gentle, poignant and uninhibited, if not especially penetrating or deep.']"

It is this:""I cried when I had no shoes—until I met a man who had no feet.""Such is the feeling that emerges from this dignified and moving report on the life of the now 74-year-old woman who, in infancy, became blind, deaf and mute as the result of scarlet fever; yet, undaunted, she later learned to ""read,"" to communicate through a complex ""touch language,"" even to speak imperfectly, and who has been by her noble example an inspiration to handicapped people all over the world.It is a delicate and sometimes painful picture of human adversity that is put on the screen of the Guild Theatre, where this extraordinary film opened last night. But it is also a brave, uplifting picture. For, just as Miss-Keller never has been reluctant to exhibit her infirmities and her triumph over them, there is no hesitation or embarrassment in this affecting film.Produced and presented by Nancy Hamilton, with expert technical aid, including a commentary by James Shute and a Morgan Lewis musical score, it consists of a compilation of old photographs that illustrate the infancy and wistful girlhood of the brave woman, some footage from an early film she made, news shots of her extensive travels and a long section showing Miss Keller as she is today.Through it all there runs an affirmation not of sadness and pity but of hope—a remarkably firm and cheerful feeling of human gallantry. One watching the serene and eager lady in her daily life and her contacts with prominent and active folks is moved by the encouraging notion that no affliction can defeat a noble soul.An equally glowing tribute also is paid by this film to the two strong and selfless women who have been Miss Keller\'s successive ""eyes,"" as well as her loyal companions. They are Annie Sullivan Macy, who died in 1936, and Polly Thompson, who has been with her constantly since that time. The intimate and dramatic association of these two women with Miss Keller is conveyed in tremendously interesting close-ups. The sense of devotion and dedication is strong in the tastefully made motion picture.""The Unconquered"" is a film for all time.Also on the bill at the Guild Theatre is Walt Disney\'s ""Stormy, the Thoroughbred,"" a forty-minute documentary about an aberrant Kentuckybred colt that is sold West to be a cow pony and later becomes a polo mount. It is a coy and perky little item, interesting mainly for its color scenes of training horses for racing, for herding cattle and for pounding around a polo field.']"

This Columbia release, directed and written by Val Guest (from a Maurice Procter novel) is about as British as British can be.In short, Mr. Guest and a capable cast headed by Stanley Baker have confronted a low-budget and rather routine plot, rolled up their sleeves and done a respectable job, with a minimum of nonsense. Two things especially hoist the picture above average: Mr. Baker\'s excellence as a hard-headed detective and Mr. Guest\'s cool, swift command of the entire, familiar situation.A murderous fugitive convict sneaks back to his old haunts, pressures some old cronies and arouses a detective who also knew him when. The chase begins—and ends—in steady, taciturn and tingling style. Furthermore, the folks involved, on both sides of the law, are human and well-played. Finally, the smooth photography—of a middle-sized industrial city and the countryside—realistically points up most of the hunt.John Crawford makes a burly killer; Vanda Godsell is most appealing as a plainspoken barmaid; Billie White-law and Donald Pleasence do well as an oddly mated couple; George A. Cooper, and Geoffrey Frederick are effective as allies of Mr. Crawford, and Joseph Tomelty and Sarah Branch are winning as a brave old man and his deaf-mute granddaughter.Don\'t expect a lot of ""Hell Is a City"" (whatever that\'s supposed to mean).

This is mostly communicated by interminable close-ups of his left eye peeping through knotholes, around trees, through car windows, around bales of hay and through door slits.The unrelieved morbidity of the son\'s obsession is distressing enough. But equally offensive are the director\'s obsession with the meaningful glance, the cameraman\'s obsession with the zoom lens and the musical director\'s obsession with percussive effects that sound as if they were left over from an old horror movie.""The Fear"" is so tediously pretentious that even sex and sadism fans will be repelled.']"

Over the decades, the category expanded; it could signal that an artist was poor, or black, or Southern, or disabled, or just plain old. A way to subordinate and exoticize, the label turned the circumstances of artists’ lives — their deafness, say, or their reclusive natures — into pathologies that overshadowed their work. It also made the canon seem far too normal: What, after all, is really more unexpected — that schizophrenic Martín Ramírez would have made collages and drawings while trapped inside a mental hospital, or that Agnes Martin would make graph after graph in gray?', 'Self-taught artists, then, have the power to teach us. What if we were willing to be surprised by all the art we see? Retaining a sense of the profound difference between artists — imagining that the art itself is that difference — makes us look at work with a kind of generosity, starting with the awareness of how easily it might never have been made at all. Take, for example, Judith Scott, recently the subject of an exhibition at the Brooklyn Museum of Art. Scott was a deaf-mute artist with Down syndrome who, before she died in 2005, produced gorgeous, multicolored, yarn-wrapped sculptures. She only started making art after she moved into a center in Oakland called Creative Growth that serves adults with disabilities, where she shared studio space and materials and interacted with teachers; before that, she had passed more than three decades of neglect in an institution in Ohio. As Matthew Higgs, the director of White Columns, a contemporary art space in New York that shows work by disabled and non-disabled artists, recently told me, “In every community in the world there is an equal number of talented individuals, but without the opportunities.”']"

She's a young woman whose widowed mother married her off to a deaf-mute potter when she was a young girl. Still quite young, she's a lotus in bloom and damp with yearning; in the opening of the picture she's praying for a child, something her husband, who's now unemployed and a drunk, can't give her. She's seduced into a relationship with the married owner of the farm where she works. Even the farmer's father calls him ''spoilt,'' but the director, Shyam Benegal, is interested in something richer than potboiler melodrama. The farmer wants to be more than his father, an ambition that included resisting an affair. (His father carried on for years, shaming his mother.) But he's drawn into a relationship with her anyway. When a streak of cowardice is finally revealed, Ms. Azmi gets to perform a monologue of sorrow and rage that's as powerful as any acted by Jane Fonda or Glenda Jackson -- actress-activists with whom she has been compared.

And, having done so, it is surprising what a good film they\'ve made of it.Not that they\'ve whipped out an epic in this somewhat expanded report on the spiritual flowering of a deaf-mute under the attentions of a young doctor on a Nova Scotian farm. And not that they\'ve thoroughly rid it of the oddly suspicious breath of theatrical melodramatics which it strongly exuded on the stage. Put at least they have made a picture which has a novel and genuine theme. And at best they have made it quite moving. It is now showing at the Strand.Perhaps the foremost reason for this happy accomplishment is the sensitive and poignant performance of Jane Wyman in the central role. As the drab and indeed repulsive deaf-mute whose bleak life is brightened and blessed by the helpful instruction of a young doctor and the birth of an illegitimate child (which is an unrelated coincidence and not a consequence), Miss Wyman brings superior insight and tenderness to the role. Not once does she speak throughout the picture. Her face is the mirror of her thoughts. Yet she makes this pathetic young woman glow with emotional warmth.Even the scenes in which she follows the instruction of the doctor, Lew Ayres, in expressing herself in sign language are affecting, despite the fact that the speed with which she learns is amazing and the symbols seem at times a bit absurd.A further asset to the picture is the quality of its decor. Good, simple, cracker-barrel interiors have the flavor of the village and the farm. And landscapes which run down to the sea\'s edge, village streets, fishing boats and weathered barns look as though they might be indigenous to Cape Breton Island, even though they are not.Under the able direction of Jean Negulesco, Mr. Ayres makes a credibly humble young doctor in a hamlet of gossipy folks. And Stephen McNally, who (as Horace McNally) played the doctor on the stage, is forcibly brutish as the town sport who secretly violates the girl. As father and aunt of the poor girl, Charles Bickford and Agnes Moorehead are good, too, and Jan Sterling does rather nicely as a doxy who can\'t keep still.Some of the scenes are pretty lurid, especially towards the end, when the deaf girl is forced to shoot the scoundrel as he comes to take her baby away. And a courtroom scene for the climax is a little grotesque when not banal. But the best of the film is absorbing, and Miss Wyman, all the way through, plays her role in a manner which commands compassion and respect.On the stage at the Strand are Andre and Steve Calgary, Blair and Dean and Freddy Martin and his orchestra.', ""THE SCREEN IN REVIEW; Jane Wyman Gives a Sensitive Performance as Deaf-Mute in 'Johnny Belinda'""]"

Freely adapted from ""Job,"" the novel by Joseph Roth, ""Sins of Man"" is a thoroughly sentimental, painstakingly somber and devastatingly complete portrait of a man in sorrow. While it is uncompromisingly tearful, it happens also to have been splendidly performed, honestly directed and handsomely produced. In sum, a well-planned conspiracy against the lachrymal duct which has been so perfectly organized that it is impervious to any resentful cry of ""You harrow me!""Our preference, frankly, is for a more ""contrasty"" negative. ""Sins of Man"" has blocked in its tragic shadows solidly, courageously ignoring any romantic sub-plot and only in a few penultimate episodes seeking to bring its heavy theme into clearer relief through recourse to a ""funny man."" Although this is a more mature approach to tragedy than the screen generally employs, and must be encouraged in principle if not in this specific instance, still there is danger in overdoing it.Sophocles himself could not have driven the fates more cruelly against the picture\'s central figure, Christopher Freyman, sexton and bell-ringer of a small church in the Tyrolean village of Zanebruck. From 1900, when the tale begins, to the current year when it reaches a moist-eyed happy ending, old Freyman is the trembling target for all the slings and arrows of ill-fortune. His wife dies giving birth to their second son, who is found to be a deaf mute. Their elder boy, Karl, refusing to follow his father\'s bell-ringing career and preferring such barbarities as aeronautics, runs off to America.Reconciled after several years, Freyman goes to America to arrange for a great specialist to restore the deaf Gabriel\'s hearing. But a plane crash kills Karl, war breaks out, Zanebruck is destroyed and from the casualty lists Freyman learns that Gabriel was among the dead or missing. So it goes, with the twentieth century Job patiently enduring his trials, living in Bowery lodging houses, scrubbing floors, carrying sandwich signs, washing dishes, living in the hope that some day he might find some one who could tell him of Zanebruck and of his missing son. That day comes at last and Job is comforted.The rôle of Freyman, with its chronological and emotional development and its tragic qualities, is one of those of which actors must dream at night, and Mr. Hersholt has handled it with a sure and tender understanding of its values. Although it is a Jannings rôle, there is no reason to praise Mr. Hersholt for a Jannings characterization; we still have some recollection of his work in ""Greed,"" filmed twenty years ago. With a performance of that excellence in his background, he becomes his own standard of comparison and this new rôle must take its place in his private gallery of ""distinguished portrayals.The picture provides, too, a pleasant screen début for Don Ameche, previously identified with the radio. As the Freyman sons when, in turn, they have reached manhood, Mr. Ameche gives a likable and straightforward performance which amply justifies Darryl Zanuck\'s announced intention of featuring him in several of the new Twentieth Century-Fox films this season. Note, too, on the credit list Allen Jenkins as a Bowery protector of Freyman, J.

It opened yesterday at the 34th Street East under the title ""To Be a Crook.""The little picture, written and directed by Mr. Lelouch a couple of years before he made ""A Man and a Womman,"" is an evident practice exercise. It is a clear job of testing his ability to put young actors through paces in roles that are written to permit imitation, and travesty, of cinema clichés.His people are four Parisian workmen who have seen so many gangster and Western films that they decide to throw up their jobs in an automobile factory and use the knowledge gleaned from films to become crooks.They practice and practice and practice. That\'s just about all they do. First, they test their nerves and their dexterity by snitching a package of chewing gum. Then they do assorted shop-lifting, and try to kidnap a streetwalker\'s dog. Meantime they are practicing judo, karate, marksmanship and horsemanship at a dude ranch. Why the last, I do not know.Finally they kidnap a film star. (She\'s a stand-in, but they don\'t know that.) This has consequences, which, alas, they do not expect.It is all rather childish business—childishly conceived and childishly played by a group of young men now fairly prominent in French films, including Jean-Pierre Kalfon and Pierre Barouh. Although they are adroit and bright as farceurs and at imitating well-known stars, what they do is superficial and repetitious. So is this little film. The nicest thing about it is its excellent black-and- white photography—bold and creatively nimble. It is credited to Jean Collomb.The girl in the case is Janine Magnan as a deaf-mute who is picked up by one of the chaps. All she does is go along as an audience—more a surrogate ma than a moll.I understand the film has had about 25 minutes cut from it, and has been re-edited from the way it was shown in France. This may account for the brevity and superfluity of the role of the girl.There are English subtitles.']"

So much in Carson McCullers\'s early novel of Singer, the deaf-mute whose silence became an expression and a magnet for all the lonely, life-impaired whites and Negroes in a Southern town, had to be up-dated and changed. And still one keeps scrutinizing the movie, almost hostilely, for where it politically stands.It is not just that we know that no Southern Negroes speak quite the way Miss McCullers\'s Portia, the Beulah-Aunt Jemima talking daughter of a proud Negro doctor, spoke, with all her ""I were\'s"" and ""They haves,"" and other exaggerated, unpoetic failures of speech—by which Miss McCullers signaled in every line just what kind of character Portia was meant to be. (The movie solves this problem by casting Portia, played by Cicely Tyson as a kind of articulate Negro militant, who expresses her rebellion by becoming a maid. Not very likely.) It is that the required changes, like who cuts up whom, and under what circumstances, in side-stepping or accommodating modern sensibilities, cause the plot and motivations to fall apart. At almost every dramatic moment, the story becomes frail in its sense.But there are a lot of lovely things. Alan Arkin, as Singer, is extraordinary, deep and sound. Walking, with his hat jammed flat on his head, among the obese, the mad, the infirm, characters with one leg, broken hip, scarred mouth, failing life, he somehow manages to convey every dimension of his character, especially intelligence. There is nothing opaque in his silences or in the moment\'s delay with which he reacts to other people\'s lines. His use of his hands seems quite normal and personal, and when he walks in the night, talking, with his hands, to himself, it seems a perfect dramatic expression of what thinking is. This is his best performance since he played a Puerto Rican on a bench in ""That\'s Me"" and it becomes more and more apparent that his talent is not clownish, but serious.Sondra Locke, in her first movie part, as the young girl who lives in Singer\'s boarding house, is as fine as she can be within the limits of a lot of rather mawkish business and corny lines. (The sappiness of life does not always transfer well, intact, to the screen; it also seems there have been enough scenes of girls checking their bodies in mirrors to last a while.) Percy Rodriguez, as the doctor, is very strong, and Chuck McCann (once the star of a TV kiddie show) does all right as Singer\'s mute, sick friend—although he plays him as a babyish imbecile, instead of as the rather more interesting, brooding Greek gone to pieces he is meant to be. Since he is the first character to appear on screen (and since he appears, inadvisably, rolling a hoop), he sets a comic note that jars through the rest of the film. Wayne Smith, in a minor part as a boy Miss Locke sleeps with, is excellent, and their love scene is done in a sentimental way, as teenagers often go to the movies to see them done.Most of the movie was shot in Selma. There seems to be a trend in films—with the coven in the Dakota in ""Rosemary\'s Baby"" and Steve McQueen\'s polo scenes at Myopia in ""The Thomas Crown Affair""—to shoot scenes in places with resonance in special orders of experience. Maybe marchers, jealous of their memories, will welcome seeing Arkin having supper at the Selma-Del.']"

He is one of 20 people who have been indicted in the case, which is centered in New York City but has included operations in Chicago and Los Angeles. The Government has sought the extradition of two suspects in custody in Mexico, and 17 others, including Ms. Paoletti Lemus, have pleaded not guilty.', 'The operation was discovered in July when four deaf and mute Mexicans walked into a Queens police station to report their plight. They led officers to two different houses in Queens crammed with more than 60 men, women and children, who were sleeping side by side on bunk beds and mattresses.

Unpretentious and almost documentary in its telling of a tense dramatic tale of a husband and wife\'s estrangement over the training of their deaf-mute child, it opens a straight, revealing vista into the heart of a problem of this sort and makes pretty vivid the anxieties and the sensations of all involved.Although the drama is essentially that of the husband and wife and of their sharply conflicting notions of what to do for their afflicted child, it actually revolves about the presence and the reactions of this little girl as she responds to the strange doings of adults and the sensitive guidance of a specialized school. And, thanks to the wonderful performance that Director Alexander Mackendrick gets from Mandy Miller, a remarkably fluent child, the rewarding development of this youngster makes the crux and suspense of the film.With a script by Nigel Balchin and Jack Whittingham, based upon a novel by Hilda Lewis, ""The Day Is Ours,"" Mr. Mackendrick has traced the poignant aspects of congenital deafness in a child from the point at which the parents first realize that their infant is unable to hear through the moment of indicated triumph when the 6-year-old youngster speaks her name. He has marked out with sharp illumination those typical and critical steps in the training of the child, when she makes her difficult contacts with other children and responds to the patient and dramatic help of trained teachers. And the climax in the progress of the youngster in her discovery of the technique of making sounds is reached with a beautiful and tenderly revealing succession of dramatic scenes.Though naturally outshone by little Miss Miller, to whom all hearts inevitably turn, the adult performers in this picture merit full appreciation, too. Phyllis Calvert is most credibly expressive of the emotions of the mother of the child, from initial despair and frustration to eventual hope and confidence. Terence Morgan gives a clear interpretation of the father whose skeptical and repressive attitudes are obviously the consequence of his submission to his own possessive mother, whom Marjorie Fielding plays. Jack Hawkins as the brusque but competent master of a school for deaf-mute tots and Edward Chapman as a difficult trustee also are interestingly volatile.Perhaps the script writers might have fashioned a little more penetrating plot if they had used a device less obvious than the suggestion of an illicit amour between the mother of the child and the school-master to disturb the atmosphere. But it may be that they have thereby given their story more popular appeal, which may bring more people to see it. If so, they may fairly be excused, for this picture, with its forthright appraisal of realities, deserves to be widely seen. It stands up alongside the American film, ""The Quiet One,"" as a penetration of the difficult world of the non-normal child.', ""THE SCREEN IN REVIEW; ' The Story of Mandy,' a British Drama at Sutton, Tells Tale of Deaf-Mute's Training""]"

For six months he remained in the care of a naturalist in Ittidez, who published a short book on him. Mute, shameless, interested only in eating, sleeping and escaping, the boy was trained like a dog to a leash and housebroken to relieve himself outside. The Government then entrusted him to Roche‐Ambroise Sicard, director of the Institute for Deaf‐Mutes in Ppris and a renowned teacher. Sicard found the boy totally unresponsive and intractable. A committee of experts headed by Philippe Pine!, one of the founders of psychiatry, finally declared te boy an incurable idiot‐ He would‐ have been put away in an insane asylum if Itard. barely 25, had not quietly challenged the diagnosis and offered to take charge. For the next six years Itard devoted several hours a day to a special training program for Victor, as the boy soon came to be called. A remarkable woman by the name of Madame Guenn virtually became his foster mother', ""When Itard made his first report to the Society of Observers of Man after six months, he documented the vast improvement in Victor's behavior and intelligence. The next report, reluctantly written after five more years of patient training, describes drastically slowed progress in the boy, failure to learn to speak, and major obstacles to further improvement. Victor fell barely yet exasperatingly short of becoming a full human person. Twenty years later Victor died in obscurity, still a charge of the state. Bird went on to a brilliant medical career and developed methods for training the partially deaf."", ""The second book treats Itard's Later career and his “legacy” to the special education of deaf‐mutes and the mentally retarded. Lane devotes his longest chapter to “The Great Sign Controversy” over whether the deaf from birth should be taught to use sign language or to talk through lip reading and special techniques."", '4. Haltingly in his account of working with Victor, and far more explicitly in his 1828 re ports on deaf‐mutes, Itard affirms the influence of the affective or emotional development of a child on its cognitive development. His words have a rare authority when he states “how false is that opinion of certain moralists who have believed that there is nothing in common between the mind [espirit] and feelings [sentiment].”', ""In his eagerness to treat both Victor's story and the disputes that hang over the training of deaf‐mutes, Lane passes over these issues too rapidly. His references to present‐day thinking and research in these fields are inadequate precisely at points where the ordinary reader and the specialist would want the subject carried further."", ""First, looking beyond the obvious inventiveness and patience of Itard's training program, Lane judiciously criticizes his methods and approach. He taxes Itard with isolating Victor too much from his peers in “a misguided attempt at total pedagogy,” and with not teaching him the sign language of the deaf, for which Victor showed a natural gift. Then Lane focuses on Pinel's original report, the one that classified Victor as an incurable idiot. “There are so many flaws in Pinel's argument that it is hard to understand why it has had so much weight.”"", ""Most disconcerting of all, Itard may have changed his own mind about Victor. In the same 1828 memorandum about speech training for selected deaf‐mutes with residual hearing, Itard cautions that one must choose only those subjects whose intelligence, judgment, work habits and willingness to take correction have been carefully tested. “Having once been gravely mistaken on this point, I take note of it here.” In quoting the sentence, Lane suggests that it applies to Victor only insofar as he had lost the capacity to imitate. In context, however, the sentence refers to the entire case of Vic tor and signifies at least a partial reversal of Itard's original diagnosis of the boy as normal, trainable and tractable. There is no getting away from the irony that, 20 years later, hard seems to have believed he wasted six years on a misguided project. He stopped mentioning Victor in his writings. He apparently preferred to be remembered as the founder of otolaryngology."", ""On two factual points I find Lane is in error. Available evidence does not establish that Hard was already working at the Institute for Deaf‐Mutes when the Wild Boy arrived in Paris. Therefore Lane's opening scene of their first encounter one day in the Luxembourg Gardens is dramatically effective but hard to justify historically. Far more significant to the assessment of Itard's accomplishment is the question of where Victor lived during his six years of training. Lane places him in Itard's house with Madame Guerin as Itard's housekeeper. According to my reading of the texts, Victor remained in residence at the Institute, where Madame Guérin appears to have been the wife of an employee. Victor had his own bedroom on an upper floor where Itard often worked with him. As the years went by Victor increasingly accompanied Hard to his home and probably stayed there from time to time. But Hard's “total pedagogy” did not entail taking the boy out of the Institute, where it is difficult to discover just how much contact he had with the other inmates""]"

GreeneJudge . . . . . John McNamaraMrs. Cavanaugh . . . . . Amzie StricklandBig John . . . . . Mickey HargitayIT\'S unfortunate that a smoothly-machined, well-acted drama like ""The Story of Esther Costello"" should have serious shortcomings. Such is the case with the British-made Columbia entry that arrived yesterday at the Palace, featuring Joan Crawford, Rossano Brazzi and a strikingly gifted girl named Heather Sears in the title role. And very interestingly the shortcomings are those of Nicholas Monsarrat\'s novel.The singularly repellent plot—the blatant, heartless exploitation of a blind deafmute—lacks complete credibility. It leaves a bitter, even sour taste that\'s impossible to whistle away. The same applies to the virtues of a harsh drama of rampant evil that remains original, curiously engrossing, and deftly shaped for unquestioning adults.As the film opens, a rich American tourist, Miss Crawford, compassionately salvages an afflicted Irish waif, Miss Sears, and doggedly assists in the girl\'s mastery of Braille at an American institution. These rehabilitation scenes are excellent, as crisply directed by David Miller and blue-printed in semi-documentary low key by Scenarist Charles Kaufman. And it must be said here that Miss Crawford, whose role repeatedly shifts from stage center, is tackling her most becoming assignment in several seasons.But the bulk of the action, and certainly the villainy, lies in the shrewd, heartless exploitation of the ""miracle"" girl on an international promotion tour engineered by Miss Crawford\'s estranged spouse, Mr. Brazzi. At the tour\'s fantastically successful peak, this handsome conniver abruptly ravishes his new protégée, thereby restoring her speech and sight. Miss Crawford arranges the deaths of herself and Mr. Brazzi (admirably suggested rather than shown) and the victimized girl marches off to enlighten a packed auditorium, trailed by a loving young reporter, Lee Patterson.To one viewer, at least, the picture\'s real miracle is that such a plot even approaches credulity, yet it does just that. Miss Crawford, Mr. Brazzi, Mr. Patterson and all the minor players are professional throughout, and for once, the injection of a puppy romance is welcome. But it is the glowing, winsome, mobile face of young Miss Sears that makes the whole thing matter at all.What, pray, is so miraculous today about a deaf-mute\'s mastery of Braille? Would mere podium appearances rake in large contributions from our country, France and Italy? And what about the terrible act that completely cures the young heroine? It\'s all cause for wonder in an off-beat picture that is smooth and anything but sweet.']"

You gather together at random any 12 men, and one of them will eventually surface as the group\'s Randle Patrick McMurphy, the organizer, the spokesman, the leading hell-raiser and free spirit, the man who accepts nothing at face value and who likes to shake up the system, sometimes just because it\'s there. The quality of Randle Patrick McMurphy depends entirely on the intensity of his opposition.Before the start of ""One Flew Over the Cuckoo\'s Nest,"" Milos Forman\'s film version of Ken Kesey\'s 1962 novel, Randle Patrick McMurphy (Jack Nicholson) was strictly small potatoes, his life distinguished by nothing except carelessness.One assumes him to have been a quick-witted but none-too-bright fellow whose vanity, drinking, whoring and short temper have earned him a minor police record consisting mostly of assault - and - battery complaints, concluding with a conviction for statutory rape. The girl, who said she was 19, was only 15.When we first meet Randle, he has served two months of his six-month sentence and has managed to get himself transferred to the state mental hospital for psychiatric observation, figuring that life in the loony bin would be easier than on the prison farm. It\'s the beginning of the end for Randle, but the ferocity of the system imposes on him a kind of crazy grandeur.""One Flew Over the Cuckoo\'s Nest,"" which opened yesterday at the Sutton and Paramount Theaters, is a comedy that can\'t quite support its tragic conclusion, which is too schematic to be honestly moving, but it is acted with such a sense of life that one responds to its demonstration of humanity if not to its programmed metaphors.Once in the bin, Randle becomes the self-proclaimed champion of the rights of the other ward patients, his adversary being Nurse Ratched, a severe, once-pretty woman of uncertain age who can be sympathetic and understanding only in ways that reinforce her authority. Nurse Ratched represents the System that all Randles must buck.As played by Louise Fletcher and defined in the screenplay by Lawrence Hauben and Bo Goldman, the film\'s Nurse Ratched is a much more interesting, more ambiguous character than in Mr. Kesey\'s novel, though what we take to be her fleeting impulses of genuine concern only make the film\'s ending that much more unbelievable.""One Flew Over the Cuckoo\'s Nest"" is at its best when Mr. Forman is exercising his talents as a director of exuberant comedy that challenges preconceived notions of good taste. It\'s not too far from the mark to describe Randle as a sort of Mister Roberts who finds himself serving aboard the U.S.S Madhouse. It\'s to Mr. Forman\'s credit that the other patients in the ward, though suffering from all sorts of psychoses, are never patronized as freaks but are immediately identifiable as variations on ourselves, should we ever go over the edge of what\'s called sanity.Mr. Nicholson slips into the role of Randle with such easy grace that it\'s difficult to remember him in any other film. It\'s a flamboyant performance but not so overbearing that it obscures his fellow actors, all of whom are very good and a few of whom are close to brilliant, including William Redfield (as an egghead patient who talks grave nonsense), Will Sampson (as a deaf-mute Indian) and Brad Dourif (as a young man with a fatal mother complex).There are some unsettling things about ""One Flew Over the Cuckoo\'s Nest."" I suspect that we are meant to make connections between Randle\'s confrontation with the oppressive Nurse Ratched and the political turmoil in this country in the 1960\'s. The connection doesn\'t work. All it does is conveniently distract us from questioning the accuracy of the film\'s picture of life in a mental institution where shock treatments are dispensed like aspirins and lobotomies are prescribed as if the mind\'s frontal lobes were troublesome wisdom teeth.Even granting the artist his license, America is much too big and various to be satisfactorily reduced to the dimensions of one mental ward in a movie like this.']"

During the past year the average attendance has been 450 to 500, of which 50 to 69 have been deaf mutes. There were 48 baptisms, of which 16 were deaf mutes; 30 confirmations, of which 11 were deaf mutes; 14 marriages, including 2 deaf mutes; 22 burials -- 2 deaf mutes and two children of mutes; communicants admitted, 22 -- 9 deaf mutes; received, 47; 16 deaf mutes; removed, 7 -- 2 deaf mutes, of which latter one was to be matron of a California institution for deaf mutes, and the other a teacher in an Indiana institution.

There was contributed $11,277 84 to the building fund, $2,308 50 to the support of the church and rector, and $153 47 to the sick and poor. The total amount raised for all purposes was $13,755. The plate contributions averaged $S2 75 per Sabbath.

GALLAUDET -- in 1814, down to the establishment of this church. His father had first conceived the idea of offering public prayer to God in the sigh language. He had himself first conceived the plan of founding the church while at the bedside of a dying child -- a deaf mute. While engaged as a tutor in the New-York institution, he had started a congregation in the University rooms. Trinity Church guaranteeing the rent, -- $300 per annum. The first service was held on Sunday, Oct. 3, 1852, 30 or 40 deaf mutes being present. By the active exertions of Bishop WAINWRIGHT and others, a committee was appointed, and raised $714 as the nucleus of a building fund. Another committee, in 1853, raised the sum to $5,000, and still another, to $10,000, with which lots were bought on Twenty-sixth-street, where it was designed to build, and the church, was incorporated Sept. 11, 1854. under its present name. In November, 1857, the Church met in the Historical Society's rooms. In May, 1658, a public meeting was held, at which Bishop WAINWRIGHT and Dr. PEET spoke, and $1,000 per annum was pledged to secure the undivided attention of the Rector, (who had been admitted to orders in 1850,) and Mr. GILLAUDET left the New-York institution where he had been employed 15 years. In July, 1859, the Church decided upon the bold policy of purchasing this Church for $70,000, (in having been built for the lamented HALSEY,) and the first service in it was held in August, 1859. A sale of the Twenty-sixth-street lots for $18,000 enabled them to pay a substantial installment on their purchase. In the event of his decease, there were several deaf mutes who could soon he qualified to take his place, and continue the services in the sign language -- some four or five, being in orders at this Time. The sermon closed with an energetic appeal to the congregation to fulfill all their duties, and strongly advocated the growth of free churches."", ""ST.

This production will be on exhibition at the Paramount beginning tomorrow.""Sarah and Son"" is an intelligently directed narrative of a young mother whose infant son is given to the care of a wealthy family by her ne\'er-do-well husband. This unfortunate woman, Sarah Storm, does not know where Jim, her husband, took the child, and Jim himself has disappeared. Some time later when she is singing to war wounded in a hospital she sees Jim, who dies just after uttering the name of ""Ashmore.""In these initial scenes the agony is piled on a little heavily, but the excellent acting of all concerned saves these episodes from being tedious. Later, after Sarah has studied grand opera singing in Europe and she comes to this city to sing in the Metropolitan, the story is graphic and affecting. There are several tense scenes in which a foster mother stoops to cheating Sarah so that she can keep the boy, Bobby, whom Sarah has not seen since he was an infant.At the outset Miss Chatterton, as Sarah, speaks with an Austrian accent. This pathetic mother, who is then striving to make a living in vaudeville with the worthless Jim, hails from Vienna. Miss Chatterton sustains this broken English for some of the scenes, and in the later passages she cleverly contrives to make Sarah\'s English improve. This is quite a remarkable feat, especially before the microphone, with constantly changing scenes spread over a period of six weeks or two months.The coincidences are conceived in a fashion that enhances the story.Sarah as a poor woman is threatened with incarceration in an insane asylum if she annoys Mr. and Mrs. John Ashmore about the child. They persist, even to their lawyer, Howard Vanning, that Bobby is their own son. Sarah is not permitted to see the boy, although she insists that she can tell whether he is her child by a birthmark.Vanning is sympathetic with Sarah, but he believes that she is mistaken. There is a charming scene where Sarah in telling Vanning about her operatic rôles does so with genuine and pleasing conceit, an idea that amuses her.It is when Mrs. Ashmore realizes that her new servant is the mother of a boy about Bobby\'s age—a deaf mute—that she is impelled to send this youngster to Sarah. The scene that follows is much too long, for one expects Sarah to look on the back of the boy\'s neck for the birthmark some time before she does. In the end she decides that he is not her son after all.The closing scenes with Bobby meeting his mother by accident and she not knowing that the young runaway is her son, are most compelling.Dorothy Arzner, who recently has been producing films with Robert Milton and alternating in the credit for them, is set forth as the director of this production. Every performance is restrained. The late Fuller Mellish Jr. is seen in the rôle of Jim. It is a good performance. Frederic March is easy-going and natural as the handsome la yer who is in love with Sarah and who is addressed by her until the last few episodes as ""Mr. Howard Vanning."" Another player who contribute; a distinguished performance is Gilbert Emery, who acts Ashmore. He has a pleasing diction and an agreeable manner. Doris Lloyd also rises to the occasion in her interpretation of Mrs. Ashmore.Young Phillippe de Lacy impersonates Bobby during the important stages of this chronicle. He is well suited to the part, but it might possibly have been better had he not been called upon to weep, because he is deprived of enjoying himself at games and sports. He is at his best during the stretch in which he runs away to his uncle\'s home.A little less attention to pathos and a little more attention to cheer would have made this even a better film than it is.']"

During those years, movies like ''To Sir With Love'' and ''Up the Down Staircase'' did nothing to alleviate my sense of high school as a tough and dangerous place (my own experience at genteel Sacred Heart Academy on Long Island notwithstanding). They did, however, offer an adult figure who seemed to understand, or at least to suffer with, the angry students. The teachers portrayed in those films by Sidney Poitier and Sandy Dennis seemed to offer to their students the possibility that there could be a chink in the isolation. The deserted schoolyard was still the place for us, but, they seemed to say, it was possible for someone to know you were there. Other films about teen-agers offered a similar solace but in a different way. Both ''Summer of '42'' and ''The Heart Is a Lonely Hunter'' dwelled in fond detail on the ordinary difficulties of teen-age life, first dates and obnoxious younger brothers, the longing to be popular and the urgent need to be unburdened of your virginity, but they placed these small and mostly comic adolescent struggles into stories that also dealt with the death of a young husband in war, or the desperate isolation of the deaf mute.""]"

This Universal-International crime melodrama, with Tony Curtis in the lead, accompanied the Palace\'s vaudeville program yesterday.Obliquely based on the astounding case of the $2,500,000 Brink\'s robbery, as transcribed in a Joseph F. Dinneen story, it emerges as a smoothly machined, unconvincing and even familiar study of a gang chieftain, his rise, fall and regeneration. While Sidney Boehm\'s text leaves much to be desired, this Aaron Rosenberg production, filmed partially on location, does project a good bit of pictorial muscularity.The city of Boston, in fact, steals the show. Picturesque glimpses of urban thorough-fares and skylines, caught by an alert camera man, remain far more absorbing and authentic than anything that occurs.Joseph Pevney\'s facile direction rather nimbly defines a good many of the incidents—not, however, the two characters on whom the whole thing hinges.Mr. Curtis plays Jerry Florea, a blatantly cunning delinquent with a mile-long record, who breezes in and out of prison and almost methodically rises to power and notoriety. He also manages to hoodwink an otherwise shrewd detective, George Nader, who, over the years, all but adopts him, thirty-two arrests included.Why, indeed? At any rate, Mr. Nader, who wisely under-plays throughout, and pretty Julie Adams, as his wife, persist. Mixed in with Mr. Curtis\' grinning platitudes about wanting, to do better is a grudging but distinct tone of respect, it would seem, for his ruthless, self-made prosperity. At least Mr. Curtis\' strutting, million-dollar appearance, in a melodrama purporting to abhor crime, drew plenty of appreciative chuckles from yesterday morning\'s customers.The climax proves to be a neat if unstartling business, and an expected cue for a last-minute, split-second regeneration of the hero—or thug-turned-hero.Mr. Nader and Miss Adams do well enough. As young Jerry, the budding delinquent, Sal Mineo contributes an effective bit in the best scene (with Mr. Nader). Jay C. Flippen, Jan Merlin and the others look in briefly from the sidelines, for Mr. Curtis, of course, shoulders most of the picture.Far from depicting a formidable criminal master mind, the actor\'s progressive, bubbling boyishness knocks the biggest hole in a film already full of them. Those who recall his best performance to date, that of the deaf-mute boxer in ""Flesh and Fury,"" also under Mr. Pevney\'s direction, may wonder if he was encouraged or merely allowed.Boston, however, comes off fine.']"

But it was not until 1999, when art critics began to praise the unusual, intricate sculptures of Judith Scott, a deaf and mute artist with Down syndrome, that Creative Growth’s board decided to change its mission. There was major interest in Scott’s work; there might also, it seemed, be a major market for it. If the professional art world was going to come to Creative Growth, the center needed to handle itself more professionally. It needed someone who understood the art market. It needed someone who knew how to sell.', 'There is no better example of a dam being removed and a creative impulse bursting forth than the case of Judith Scott, who was brought to Creative Growth in 1987 by her fraternal twin sister, Joyce. The sisters were born outside of Cincinnati in 1943 and were reunited in California after 40 years apart. Judith never learned to speak, having lost her hearing in infancy from scarlet fever. Her deafness went undiagnosed for decades, so she never learned to speak or sign. Her muteness was attributed to low I.Q. Doctors advised the Scotts to institutionalize Judith and cease all contact. When the sisters were 7, their parents took Judith in the middle of the night from the bed she shared with Joyce and left her at the Columbus State Institution. Joyce, violating her mother’s wishes, visited the institution as an adult and found her sister distraught, living in near total isolation. When Judith showed an interest in creating art, her crayons were confiscated. According to Joyce, Judith was declared ‘‘too retarded to draw.’’']"

The second and main thing wrong is that this is the kind of film that could have been made only in French, if indeed it had to be made at all. There is no other language in which vague meanderings and frequent meals take on such consequence. Nor would the absolutely pointless light interlude take on the importance in Swedish, say, that it carries here. These are Jean-Charles Tacchella\'s principal directorial tools, and he uses them often in ""Soupçon,"" if not well.Mr. Tacchella, who appears really to have outdone himself in directing the airily successful ""Cousin, Cousine,"" this time strikes a mood that is superficial without being in the least bit light. At the glum beginning of ""Soupçon,"" which opens today at the Baronet, François and Brigitte Dupuis are seen telling their three children that they plan to live apart. The children, whose own family situations with their spouses seem meant to turn the film into a parade of insightful anecdotes, are at first surprised at their parents\' daring. They soon get used to the arrangement, and the various characters go their separate ways, meeting only for brief discussions and light snacks.François, played by Jean Carmet, is meant to seem something of a cut-up, and he is also a self-proclaimed bohemian. So he falls down in a subway station, waits for a good Samaritan to revive him, and then explains ""I just wanted to see if anyone cared."" At a restaurant, he hands the young woman a note reading ""I am a deaf-mute, can you help me?"" and then pretends to regain his speech miraculously. Incredibly, the young woman is impressed. She invites François home for a tryst, gets into bed, and asks him to close the window. While doing so, he looks across the courtyard and sees a woman cooking a duck with truffles. They trade recipes, and soon the woman is inviting him over for a meal. He goes, asking the first woman to wait for him. Francois is a cute guy, and this is his cute movie.Brigitte (Marie Dubois), taller and steadier but just as kittenish in her way, runs a boutique. She dates a film buff who pretends to lose his wallet in the store, then makes a date with Brigitte for a night when there\'s nothing interesting at the Cinémathéque. It is virtually impossible to worry about where all this will end, and indeed ""Soupçon"" isn\'t a film to set either its characters or its audience to brooding. Affecting a spirit of adventurousness, and charting these two characters\' journeys into supposedly unknown waters, the film is altogether without risk or surprise, which is even more damaging than its being without humor.Some of the lesser characters are lively, and a few of the episodes are successfully offbeat. And ""Soupçon"" is visually pleasant enough to seem less of a trial than it might be. These aren\'t strong points of recommendation, but they do help make the time go by.']"

Then let the man go back on his part of the bargain and get well, and you have the rest of it—for your practiced imagination will not fail you. But it will not supply all of the comic incidents Mrs. Rinehart has thought of, nor the brightening bits of business by the most agreeable Mr. Dix.Otto Hoffman, too, as a deaf-mute employed in the hospital, gives vitality to his part, and the work of the others in the cast is satisfactory. Also the photoplay has been well staged and its photography is notably good.The picture, in fact, suffers chiefly by its length. It ought to be a two or three reel comedy, and as such it would be merry from beginning to end.

But by bestowing speech on Singer, Ms. Gilman took license with a character of symbolic importance to generations of deaf readers \x97 a decision she justified because, McCullers wrote, Singer was once taught to speak as a boy. Inevitably, though, Ms. Gilman has made it difficult for a deaf actor to play Singer, now a speaking role.', 'The play had its premiere in Atlanta in 2005, directed by the Tony Award winner Doug Hughes (“Doubt”), with a hearing actor cast as Singer; it drew some strong reviews, and no objections from organizations for the deaf. But now that the play is receiving a major production at New York Theater Workshop, starting on Nov. 13, deaf actors and deaf theater groups have begun to protest the artistic and casting choices involving the Singer role.', '“A hearing actor playing a deaf character is tantamount to putting a white actor in blackface,” said Linda Bove, a deaf actress and board member of the Alliance for Inclusion in the Arts, an advocacy group for minority, disabled and deaf artists.', 'The alliance, with the National Association of the Deaf, the Deaf West Theater and others, has demanded that Mr. Hughes and the New York Theater Workshop cast a deaf actor as Singer in the latest production \x97 and, in doing so, fire the actor Henry Stram, who played Singer to acclaim in Atlanta and is resuming the role in New York. Rehearsals began on Tuesday.', 'Several deaf actors put forth that demand recently at a private meeting, organized by New York Theater Workshop, with Mr. Hughes and others involved in the New York production. The discussion was emotional at times, participants on both sides said. Mr. Hughes, in an interview this week, said that he made clear at the meeting that he would not replace Mr. Stram, but that he was sympathetic to the deaf actors’ concerns and was eager to work with them on a future project at the workshop.', '“Although I’m truly regretful that there are those in the deaf acting community who were offended by the decision I made, I cannot in good conscience fire Henry Stram in order to reduce the perceived offense,” Mr. Hughes said.', '“There is no question that there are woefully few opportunities for deaf artists,” he added. “And people have every right to suggest to us that we have miscast this role. But we also have every right to respectfully disagree on that point.”', 'Alexandria Wailes, a prominent deaf actress who attended the meeting, said in an interview that the Singer casting decision was the latest in a string of insults by television, film and theater producers who have picked hearing actors to play deaf characters or rebuffed deaf actors who went to auditions without their own interpreters.', 'The audition process for the role of Singer in the 2005 Atlanta production included “due-diligence outreach” to the deaf population about possible actors, said Margot Harley, artistic director of the Acting Company, which commissioned Ms. Gilman’s adaptation and collaborated with Mr. Hughes, the director.', 'A casting agent contacted several deaf theater groups for recommendations of actors, according to Ms. Harley’s notes from the time. Eight names were provided; two actors auditioned for Mr. Hughes, but it was judged that neither could speak well enough to play the part of Singer. (Ms. Harley and Jim Nicola, artistic director of the New York Theater Workshop, said they fully supported the decision to keep Mr. Stram in the role.)', 'Some leading deaf actors disputed that enough research was done in advance of the 2005 production. Among others, Ed Waterstreet, artistic director of Deaf West Theater, said in an interview that the Atlanta auditions and production had “flown under the radar” of deaf theater directors and actors nationally. Ms. Harley said that Deaf West Theater was among the organizations asked for names of deaf actors.', 'Mr. Stram learned sign language for “The Heart Is a Lonely Hunter,” though for much of the play he acts as a silent confidant for other characters who are aching to talk. While the deaf actors say they appreciate Mr. Stram’s effort, they object not only to what they say is his lack of authenticity but also to the decision to have Singer speak. Mr. Waterstreet of Deaf West, among others, says the play’s suggestion that speaking is the best way for a deaf character to express himself is a setback to deaf artists.', 'One of the deaf actors who auditioned for the role of Singer in Atlanta, Lewis Merkin, said this week that he did not recall his audition with Mr. Hughes, which was why he did not protest at the time of the Atlanta production.', '“For me, the bigger picture matters as much as this one production \x97 there aren’t enough roles for deaf actors, and there aren’t enough deaf actors being hired for deaf roles,” Mr. Merkin said. “And culturally, I do think there’s a strong argument that inhabiting the role of a deaf character is something that only a deaf actor can do with true understanding.”', 'Ms. Gilman, the playwright, said in an interview that she believed her choice of allowing Singer to speak was important for the character, and she noted that she drew on McCullers’s own writing for his words, including a letter in the novel that Singer wrote. In response to the protests from the deaf actors, she said she was considering “reimagining” the opening and ending of the play so that it can be adapted for future productions to cast a nonspeaking actor in the role of Singer.', 'Hearing Man in Deaf Role Stirs Protests in New York']"

In Hamburger\'s first novel, Helen Michaelson, a discontented housewife whose husband is slowly dying, is a tourist who aspires to be a pilgrim; her ne\'er-do-well gay son, Jeremy, is a selfcentered ball of snittiness. Visiting Jerusalem with a Jewish-American tour group in the summer of 2000, they\'re vainly hoping for some kind of spiritual revelation. Instead, Helen has a tepid affair with an unctuous rabbi, and Jeremy, after fruitlessly attempting to seduce a stuttering yeshiva student, picks up a deaf-mute Palestinian sock fetishist. As the Michaelsons endure ""Millennium Marathon 2000,"" a prepackaged trip through the Holy Land in air-conditioned buses, the sadder, grimmer sides of Israel slowly overwhelm both them and Jeremy\'s new lover. The novel is consistently amusing, particularly when Hamburger offers barbed observations about the banalities of tourist culture: ""A plastic fan that declared your support for the Jewish state and opened up into an umbrella?"" But that mocking tone eventually sours the book. No one is spared Hamburger\'s satirical darts, and the Michaelsons are so mercilessly caricatured -- Jeremy, sporting ""camouflage cutoffs, a purple tank top with the message POOT! in silver glitter, and a diamond stud in his nose,"" is offended when he is identified as American -- that it\'s hard to summon up much sympathy for them, even when the atmosphere chills.']"

The nicely refurbished showcase occupies the site of the former Alden Theater.Rather ironically, perhaps, the best part of the program is the supplement, an exquisitely wrought vignette about two teen-agers in love — a deaf-mute girl and a young musician. By any standards, this truly endearing fragment of moviemaking is extraordinary. Not so, however, the longer ""Father of a Soldier,"" filmed in the republic of Georgia and starring a prestigious old actor named Sergo Zakhariadze.As a spunky, fiery and stubborn farmer who careers into uniform and the thick of the rout of the Nazis as he desperately seeks his soldier son. Mr. Zakhariadze won the top-actor prize at last year\'s Moscow Film Festival. Unquestionably he deserved some kind of prize for energy, for the old actor (who resembles the American comic-strip character Snuffy Smith) huffs, puffs, bellows and sprints past younger gun-toters, in a series of splashy battle sequences, like a jackrabbit.Toward the all too predictable and contrived climax, there is one splendidly written and played scene when the indignant old man stops some Soviet tanks from flattening a vineyard. And Mr. Zakhariadze is truly affecting when he wordlessly cradles his dying son in his arms.But while the picture itself is well produced and graphically directed by Rezo Chkeidze, it remains in a rather plodding and even familiar format, with a sentimentality all but punctured by Mr. Zakhariadze\'s stentorian bellowing.We wish the acting award had been shared, instead, by the two youngsters in ""A Ballad of Love,"" though this picture did win the Moscow festival\'s short-subject prize and surely deserved it.

It was made at the Riga Studios in Latvia, under a young director of uncommon skill and insight named Mikhail Bogin, who wrote the screenplay with Yuri Chulyukin. Ever so simply and sweetly, minus one drop of saccharine, the picture conveys the growing love of the spirited oboist and the beautiful girl in her silent world who studies at a pantomime theater for deaf mutes.""What is music like?"" she scribbles. There is a moment of freezing beauty with the boy watching the girl as the balcony scene from Romeo and Juliet is pantomimed on the stage.

Because of their social position, these two aristocrats are permitted to eavesdrop on the child's confession in his sordid underground prison, then given a ringside seat at his hanging. The violence of this spectacle is such that Duke Signoretto Ucria hopes it will both unstop his daughter's ears and ''unstick her lips.'' But Marianna Ucria is possessed of an imperturbable calm. ''For living visitors like Dante,'' she thinks as she watches the prisoners, ''hell can even be beautiful to look at'' -- a surpassingly literate and philosophical assessment from such a young girl.

Because she is spared the chaos and distraction of noise, Marianna finds that she can read people's thoughts.

What will cure this case of ''hysterical'' -- in other words, female -- deafness and muteness? There are passages the reader dreads, afraid to be returned with the Duchess to the spoken word, to the implicit capitulation that would be signaled if she deigned to talk. Might this happen at the death of uncle husband? At Marianna's discovery of physical passion, when she redeems what the rapist stole?

It may not be Chaney exactly that Mr. Cagney gives us in this film, but it is a person of reasonable resemblance and comparable complexity.As all who remember Chaney and his widely varied screen roles will recall, he was billed as ""the man of a thousand faces"" because of his remarkable skill in make-up and character change. But because of his strange, retiring nature, he was also known as ""the man of mystery."" And it is this facet of his personality that is most diligently and dramatically explored.Authentically, Chaney\'s parents are presented as deaf and mute, and his boyhood skill at communicating with them is credited for much of his later skill at pantomime. A powerful sympathy for people who are ""different"" is also traced to this experience of his youth, but his urge to keep his real life a secret is charged to difficulties with his first wife.Affectionate research for the story by Ralph Wheelwright accounts for much that is true. Circumspection and a script of no great consequence by three writers are responsible for fictional flaws. But true or not, the drama is essentially that of a long-suffering man who pours his own suffering into his acting. It is the old broken-heart-under-the-greasepaint theme.With not too much help from the screenplay, Mr. Cagney none the less gives a stirring sense of the actor\'s devotion to his first wife, to his infant son, to his aging parents and to his profession, which he stubbornly pursues through a hard career in vaudeville to eventual stardom in Holly wood. Being Mr. Cagney, it is difficult for him to remove all the familiar Cagney cockiness and pugnacity from the role. Even so, there is an abundance of tenderness, sensitivity and pride in his creation of the driven actor. This is the heart of the film.Mr. Cagney also manages to do a superlative job of taking on the make-up that allows him to simulate Chaney as two of his most famous ""monsters""—those in ""The Phantom of the Opera"" and ""The Hunchback of Notre Dame."" And he gives an awesome reproduction of Chaney playing a key scene as the twisted-legged, torso-dragging cripple in the earlier silent film, ""The Miracle Man.""Indeed, the few scenes that sketch the nature of film-making in the early days at the studio of Universal, the company that has made this present film, are immensely flavorsome and exciting. They suggest the wild imagination and verve that went into early movies. This film could do with more such scenes.It could, in fact, make room for them at the not very great expense of a lot of footage given over to vaudeville hoofing, which is rather hackneyed, and the troubles of the actor with his first wife. While Dorothy Malone tries hard and not ineptly to make something of the vagaries of this odd dame, she cannot make us understand her or have much sympathy. Neither do we get much more than standard devotion and sentiment from Jane Greer as the ubiquitous vaudeville dancer who stands by Chancy and becomes his second wife.Jim Backus as a glib press agent and loyal friend is conventional too, and Robert J. Evans as Irving Thalberg, the famous producer, is unspeakably poor. It is, indeed, an irony that one of the most professional persons ever to work in Hollywood should be played so amateurishly as Thalberg is by this monotonous actor. Joseph Pevney\'s direction has a curious affection for clichés, but Mr. Cagney rises above it. He etches a personality.']"

There was her mother's wretched affair with the German writer, Georg Herwegh, and her mother's early death. Her deaf‐mute brother and a grandmother were drowned in a shipwreck close to Nice. Her surviving brother, Sasha, had an illegitimate son by an English girl who threw herself in the Rhone. Herzen—the largest figure in Tata's world—had three children by the wife of his lifelong friend and political ally, Nicolai Ogarev. Ogarev, “poor Nick,” an almost archetypal cocu content, surrendered his wife to Herzen and gave the children his name (From what we know of his wife's insanely hysterical character, it may have been done with relief.) The children were Liza, who killed herself when she was 17, and twins who died at the age of 3. Family legend has the boy‐twin telling his mother, before his death, “You have a heart of stone.” “All Ogarev's children are clever,” wrote Tata innocently, before learning the truth. She watched the wretchedly difficult and unhappy Liza calling her father “Uncle” and her uncle “Father” while her odious mother slowly destroyed her “with grimaces and sneers.” The Herwegh story had affected Tata profoundly. When a rejected suitor tried to blackmail her, Tata said to her father, “... so I found my Herwegh.”"", ""The Nechayev‐Bakunin upheaval ended rapidly, in less than six months, after which Tata slipped into the role she was to assume for life. She became Aunt Tata, which was the fate Bakunin had entreated her to avoid: “Do you want to be a Nanny to Sasha's children?” She devoted herself to Olga's French household and to Sasha's, in Florence and Switzerland. Her letters were written by the middle‐aged virginal aunt everyone had seemed to want her to be: but she was barely 27. There exists a photo of Tata taken with Sasha's grown family in Switzerland. All of Sasha's sons were dark, bearded and prematurely bald, which gave them a vague resemblance to Landru. It is impossible to fell in the double row of identical bald, bearded men who is 20 and who is 35. Tata is white‐haired, wornlooking, with nothing left of her beauty but her fine datk eyes. She died at the age‐ of 87, in 1931. What is less known is that Herzen's younger daughter lived on, in Paris, until 1953. Her life span and her father's together stretched across more than 140 years, from the burning of Moscow to the of Stalin. She is still remembered as a deaf old lady who used an old‐fashioned ear trumpet into which, during the Occupation, friends would bellow such tidings as, “The war is going badly,”—information which, once she had grasped it, Herzen's survivor accepted with the utmost equanimity. ■""]"

But nuclear power champions like Alvin Weinberg, the longtime director of America’s Oak Ridge National Laboratory, countered that nuclear could supply energy enough to forestall the social collapse the neo-Malthusians feared. In the end, the green revolution and the demographic transition that followed third-world economic development met food needs and limited population growth, now predicted to level off at 10 billion by 2100.

They had defeated other ultraconservative candidates, such as Ronald Reagan’s nominee Robert Bork, focusing on their published opinions, public statements, and scholarship to demonstrate that the nominees’ views on hot-button issues such as abortion and civil rights were outside the political mainstream.

Prominent black law professors testified, expressing concern about Thomas’s hostility to school desegregation and affirmative action, but Thomas had no scholarly career and hence no scholarship.

Many members of the voting block that modern politicians rely on for electoral victories were students back then, and some actually participated in such lurid events. Even the leading politicians of the day can’t plead innocence–no one could shock George W. Bush with a story of 1966 college promiscuity, surely. Influential retirees, CEOS, and even some of our parents were once those starry-eyed college bohemians out to change that horribly straight-laced society. And they succeeded, to a great extent: the morals and ideals that shape America today are radically different than they were a generation ago. Free-love is not the all-encompassing ideal that some may have hoped it would be, but nor is abstinence-only a plausible educational option in this country, much as Mitt Romney would like to have you think so. David Brooks, so perceptive about the transformation of today’s college students into Organization Kids, also observes this generation-gap closing trend, in his 2000 book Bobos in Paradise, “In short, over the past few years the educated class has domesticated lust by enshrouding it in high-mindedness. The Bobos [Bourgeois Bohemians] have taken sex, which for centuries has been thought to be arousing or sinful or possibly dangerous, and they have made it socially constructive.” It’s not so hard for parents to talk about sex with their teenagers with the litany of reading on the subject. No longer, either, are books like The Tropic of Cancer taboo. The Catcher in the Rye is required reading for most tenth graders. Because of the cultural changes in place since the generation who went to college “back when it was college” grew up and took over, my generation doesn’t have to leave home, in many cases, to have those “three and a half metamorphoses” that Hillary Rodham wrote of in letters to a high school confidant.']"

What ever the combinations or the wiles of politicians, it is the sober thoughtfulness of the religious element that, more than any other, gives public opinion its final direction. Politicians may overbear it for a time. They did so in 1854, when, against the protest of thirty-five hundred New-England clergymen, and of one hundred and fifty of the most prominent of the clergymen of this city, they repealed the Missouri Compromise. The remonstrance was that the act not only opened the door to an unrighteous extension of slavery, but that it would ""produce alienation of feeling between different sections of our beloved country, great agitation and perilous dissension."" The majority in Congress turned a deaf ear. They repealed the compromise at the bidding of the slave power, and the result was a train of consequences that led straight to this bloodiest rebellion the world ever saw. Unfit as it is for preachers of the gospel to mingle in the ordinary political broils of the day, yet when vital principles are involved, when the life of the country is at stake -- in these great junctures, when passion and prejudice should be hushed and calm discretion rule the hour, it is every way meet that Christian ministers who are isolated from the political arena, whose calling it is to study those great principles which are the only true elements of national, as well as individual safety and prosperity, should speak, and boldly too.

He used every occasion - a date marking the maltreatment of a human-rights activist, a national or international occasion, or reports from human-rights activists themselves - to describe in moving, eloquent terms the repressive nature of Soviet society today. These steadily repeated charges, over three years, did not fall on deaf ears. The substantial Soviet and East- bloc bureaucracies, up and down the lines to their capitals, had to respond to what they knew to be the realities described by Ambassador Kampelman. Often, the East's responses were pitiful. The negotiations produced more than these public-broadcast and in- channel challenges. The conference agreed to hold a new series of meetings, at which the human rights and other violations of the East bloc will be further elaborated. This Helsinki process systematizes the West's challenge to the East bloc on human- rights grounds.""]"

It appears the General wished, first of all to obtain more exact information, so as to understand the political questions fully, and what the military resources of the States really are. So he asked for time, that he might reflect and consult -- it may be the King, or it may be the chiefs who served under him. This is most probably the reason why some persons are already announcing GARIBALDI's refusal, and others his probable departure. In the meantime there is going on about the General a cross-fire of opinions and counsels, for one party wish him to stay, so as to be at hand for some bold, but unseasonable blow, to be struck sooner or later, and another party would fain see him again defending a noble cause in those distant regions that formed the first theatre of his heroic exploits -- so heroic, indeed, that since the days of COLUMBUS, no Italian has ever been more popular in America than he.

It is a universe outside the universe, a creation that exists parallel to creation. Auschwitz lies on the other side of life and on the other side of death. There, one lives differently, one walks differently, one dreams differently. Auschwitz represents the negation and failure of human progress; it negates the human design and casts doubts on its validity. Then, it defeated culture; later, it defeated art, because just as no one could imagine Auschwitz before Auschwitz, no one can now retell Auschwitz after Auschwitz. The truth of Auschwitz remains hidden in its ashes. Only those who lived it in their flesh and in their minds can possibly transform their experience into knowledge. Others, despite their best intentions, can never do so.

In one manufacturing district alone, over nine thousand persons have been for a long period wholly without employment, and are now suffering a degree of wretchedness, the details of which are harrowing.

Whatever the numerical majority among the people in favor of Mr. LINCOLN, however well distributed that majority was from the Atlantic to the Pacific, yet had our gallant soldiers in the field shown themselves at variance with it, there would have been room for serious misgiving. Of course, it cannot be imagined that our heroic armies would have abandoned their flag, however much they might have disagreed with the popular will in this election; yet they would have been more than men had not such a fact chilled their ardor, and generated a certain estrangement between them and the people. What gives this election its crowning security and glory is, that it meets the will of our soldiers in the field just as decidedly as of our people at home. The voters who are under orders pass the same judgment upon President LINCOLN as those who still remain in civil life. There is a unanimity of conviction and of feeling between the military and civil elements engaged in the cause, that supplies the last consummate pledge of success. No popular declaration for the Baltimore Platform would have given a perfect confidence, if the military declaration had been adverse to it. The drilled and trained veterans of the field are the most necessary of all instrumentalities to the overthrow of the rebellion. Had they sided with the Chicago Platform, and announced by their votes that in their estimation the war was a ""failure,"" and that the time had come for a ""cessation of hostilities,"" what a hollow mockery would have been all these rejoicings over the decision of the people that the war must and shall go on. Were such the manifested morale of this army, we might well turn a deaf ear to all these shouts of civic victory, and set the cause down as doomed. But nothing of that kind appears. In spite of all their hardships undergone, and all their blood spilled, the soldiers are even more staunch for the war than when they went fresh from their homes. All their suffering for the flag has but strengthened their resolution to stand by it to the last. They vied with the people in pledging themselves to this at the recent election. It is this which gives the late election result its full triumphant rounding -- its last finishing guarantee.']"

As well might the running of our cars to Harlem River interfere with their vested rights. One object this Company had in selecting Seventieth-street as the crossing point, (although a street lower down would be much more desirable,) was to avoid any controversy with the Harlem Railroad, as the grade at Seventieth-street at its intersection with Fourth-avenue is of sufficient heighth to allow our cars to pass over theirs on the bridge now built at that point, and thus would be no interference. Seventieth-street is uninhabited, there being but one house on its line, and that one in course of erection. The construction of this branch track will involve a very considerable outlay with no prospect of any direct benefit, as the Company purposes to run to the Central Park without any additional charge. The vast numbers of the people who visit the Park residing in the eastern section of the City have repeatedly solicited us to obtain this privilege, in order that they may enjoy the same facilities in reaching the Park as are now enjoyed by the more favored residents of the western side of the City. There is no other line now established, or likely to be established, that can afford this accommodation to the extent required except the Third-avenue Railroad Company; and when they are willing to incur the expense, and run their cars at no extra charge, in order that the people may be gratified, it does seem to me that points of questionable validity ought not to be raised against them by those who are supposed to administrate for the public good.

Ratcliffe, William Colvin and Lloyd Whitlock, written by John McDermott, directed by William James Craft; ""An Irish Fantasy,"" produced by Dr. Hugo Riescnfeld. At the Colony Theatre.The Soviet film,. ""The China Express,"" now at the Cameo, deals with the down-trodden Chinese in a rather original and clever way. It tells virtually of a mutiny of the coolies aboard a train running from Nanking to Suchow, the opening scenes of the film, a silent one, being very interesting.There is the railway station and the grinning policeman. His risibles are tickled by the misfortunes of others. The train is in the Nanking station and the various types of passengers are perceived hurrying to board it. There is the first class for the white men, the Mandarins and moneyed merchants; the second class coaches for the less fortunate persons and the third class compartments into which are herded the coolies, artisans and peasants. And in a baggage car there are the children who have been sold by their parents and others for work in textile factories.The fireman of the train recognizes his little sister among the unfortunate youngsters. He learns that the other members of his family have perished in a flood.The train waits for a member of the diplomatic corps of a European country and as soon as he has taken his place in what is called the International Car, the train glides slowly out of the station.The comfort and revelry of the first class in the International Cat are contrasted with scenes in the third class compartments. A blind, old poet refers to the life of the happy past. He pleads with his comrades to resent the tyranny of the wealthy classes. The fireman is presumed to hear the moaning of his little sister who is suffering with fever. The merchant who had bought her says that he has made a bad bargain. European overseers ignore the child\'s request for water and one of these drunken white men treats the girl cruelly. The fireman, who has wandered from the locomotive, asks another of the overseers to protect his sister. When he finds that his pleas fall on deaf ears, he stabs the drunken European.This ends in the military guard coming forth with their bayoneted rifles to quell the disturbance and punish the slayer. The coolies, however, hold their own and soon they open up cases of firearms and fire upon the guards.The train speeds on its way and a white man climbs over to the locomotive and with a pistol forces the driver to keep at his post for a while. Finally there is a tussle and the driver is thrown off the train.It is a jumble of incidents in the end, devoted to showing the reprehensible conduct of the Europeans and the uniformed Chinese and in the last scene, the Chinese Express, after a switch has been turned to stop the train and then turned back again by a revolutionary sympathizer, continues on its way.Except for the two Europeans, the players are Chinese. They have been competently directed. The film is another Soviet argument, in which the Russians this time take up the cudgels for the Chinese.Other Photoplays.""Song o\' My Heart,"" the movietone film with John McCormack, will have its premiere at the Forty-fourth Street tomorrow night.The Little Carnegie Playhouse is offering ""Paris"" until tomorrow and ""The Trespasser"" until Friday.""The Awful Truth"" is to be seen at the Film Guild Cinema until tomorrow, after which ""Napoleon\'s Barber"" will be shown until Friday.The Fifty-fifth Street Playhouse is showing ""Because I Loved You,"" a dialogue film in German.The Little Picture House offers ""The Return of Sherlock Holmes"" today; from tomorrow until Friday ""Charming Sinners"" will be the feature picture.""Such Men Are Dangerous"" is at the Roxy; ""Lord Byron of Broadway"" at the Capitol; ""Only the Brave"" at the Paramount; ""Sally"" at the Warners\' Strand; ""The Love Parade\' at the Rivoli; ""Hit the Deck"" at the Hippodrome; ""The Rogue Song"" at the Astor; ""Disraeli"" at the Central; ""The Vagabond King"" at the Criterion; ""Puttin\' on the Ritz"" at the Earl Carroll; ""Mamba"" at the Gaiety; ""The Case of Sergeant Grischa"" at the Globe; ""Song of the West"" at the Warners\', and ""The Green Goddess"" at the Winter Garden.']"

The poem also deeply affected T. S. Eliot; echoes of its desolate, twilight world appear in ''The Hollow Men.'' Throughout the years Dowson's haunting, heartfelt lyric poetry of yearning and regret has resonated with a wide spectrum of readers. ''One feels the pressure of his life behind every line,'' William Butler Yeats wrote of his friend. In his biography, ''Madder Music, Stronger Wine,'' Jad Adams, who has written a book on Indian politics and another on Tony Benn, illuminates, with penetrating understanding and sensitivity, how life presented Dowson ''with suffering, and he returned it as beauty.'' Born in 1867, Dowson began writing poetry as a teenager. At Oxford, Adams writes, ''Dowson declared he would live as an artist, whatever the cost -- and the cost would be great.'' After moving to London, he managed for a while to combine nightly carousing with working industriously during the day at his writing and his father's dry-dock business. In 1894, the balance tipped precipitously for the depressive, fragile Dowson, who when sober was gentle and charming but under the influence of absinthe became ''almost literally insane,'' according to the poet Arthur Symons.+Dowson's parents, weakened by tuberculosis, committed suicide within months of each other, and he also was stricken with the disease.+Despite growing acclaim for his poetry and fiction, he was unable to find steady work. Worst of all, his marriage proposal to his muse, Adelaide Foltinowicz, whom he had loved platonically since she was 11, fell on deaf ears. Hope and health long gone, Dowson had become a kind of Bartleby figure, sighted in bars, ravaged by tuberculosis, poverty and alcoholism, but still feverishly writing away on scraps of paper. He died at the age of 32. Adams's artful, assured biography is a moving evocation of the sadly prophetic truth of one of Dowson's most quoted lines, ''They are not long, the days of wine and roses.''

Thus, when the subject of volunteering was first broached, then turned a deaf ear--dubbing the aspirants for bubble reputation,"" feather-bed soldiers,"" and with other titles quite as disheartening as they were unenviable, and to a certain extent uncalled for.On a certain occasion, however, a prominent British statesman, who spoke more truth than poetry, remarked in Parliament that Canadians, in case of a disturbance with foreign Powers, would be obliged to guard themselves and their homes by local or volunteer soldiery -- further saying that Canada was not behaving in that upright, loyal and manly spirit which should characterize the people who boasted of being descendants of the great Anglo-Saxon race, and also the subjects of Britain\'s Queen, VICTORIA I. This sneer had more effect upon the sensibilities of Canadians generally, than anything which had been done or said for years previous. Then, again, the event known as the Trent affair, added fuel to the fire, the consequence being that men of influence, prominent politicians and ambitious citizens called for the organization of a strong volunteer force. The events of 1861 had electrified the nervous and caused the loyal and brave to tremble; the eyes of the world were upon little Canada, and she must prove to her Queen that her sons were equal to any emergency. Government authorized the organization of volunteer corps in every section of the Province. In 1862 the House of Assembly was informed that there were at that period 13,390 volunteers -- but that nearly 1,450 of these had failed to be properly organized, and disbanded -- the really efficient numbering 11,940. From June, 1862, to February, 1863, the force increased wonderfully, and at that date a total organization of 25,010 was reported. Drill instructors from the regiments of the line and twenty Brigade Majors, ten for Lower and ten for Upper Canada, were appointed to superintend the companies of volunteers, and the progress which was observable every month at battalion drill, or on brigade field-days, astonished the people of Canada, who then acknowledged the fact that private citizens (though they had snoozed in feather-beds) made as promising soldiers as ever shouldered muskets. In September, 1863, a grand volunteer demonstration took place at Brantford, and shortly after another at Toronto, several thousand volunteers being present, and executing the intricate evolutions of a field day with a precision which was highly eulogized by old military men. Another display of this description took place at Drummondville, near Niagara Falls, on Friday, June 17 inst., and as the most perfect success attended the affair, I inclose you a brief sketch of proceedings -- not confining myself to the review alone, as the circumstances and surroundings were in themselves as amusing and instructive as the principal feature of the occasion.']"

No attempt has been made to render this a movie, for it is as faithful a transcription of the narrative as one could well imagine. The producer has not sparred for a happy ending, and in portraying the conduct of the scandalmongers he has found a way to include a little comedy here and there without exaggerating the characters.""The Scarlet Letter"" was directed by Victor Seastrom, an earnest Swedish director who gained no little fame through his production ""The Stroke of Midnight,"" a picture which has never been exhibited publicly in this country. Mr. Seastrom also made the film version of ""He Who Gets Slapped."" The adaptation of Hawthorne\'s classic was entrusted to Frances Marion, whose clever script for ""The Dramatic Life of Abraham Lincoln"" assisted materially in the production of that masterful study of the martyred President.Louis B. Mayer, head of the Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer studio, could not have chosen a better director than Seastrom for Nathaniel Hawthorne\'s narrative. He is painstaking in studying his characters, and it was to his advantage to have Lillian Gish in the principal rôle, that of Hester Prynne. Miss Gish has a strong inclination for such parts, and in this vehicle she gives an excellent, conception of the courage of a young woman in the face of sneering, scorn and tittle-tattle. It causes one to contrast those days with the present time; the fashions of the past with the feminine creations of our generation. She is charming. She falls from grace, and after the perfunctory trial she is condemned to bear the letter ""A,"" to tell the world that she has sinned.After the preliminary scenes near Boston, the director loses no time in depicting the shameless bigotry of the people, by first showing Hester Prynne\'s canary escaping from its cage and then having the young woman locked in the stocks for unseemly merriment and prancing through the lanes on the Sabbath. Actually she had only run after her bird, and this caused her to be late for the church service. A splendid idea of the little it took to start wagging tongues is obtained through the glimpes one has of the congregation, who look at Hester with the eyes of Pharisees eager to be present at her punishment.In those good old days it was the law that no engaged couples should be permitted to kiss until they were married. Hence they are pictured talking through a long tube. No feminine underwear was permitted to be hung on a clothesline, where it might meet the eyes of the men, and through this edict Mr. Seastrom displays a touch of comedy.It was with not a little pleasure that one perceived Mistress Hibbins rudely delivered into the hands of the mighty by the cunning of the loquacious Giles. He enters the gossiper\'s home, puts on her bonnet while she is asleep, and, while standing near an open window, delivers a nasty opinion of the Governor and the Beadle, just as those serious-minded gentlemen are passing. Mistress Hibbins\'s protestations of innocence fall on deaf ears, and she is sentenced to be ducked by means of a primitive implement which causes the punishment to be quite an excellent entertainment to others, especially to those who had suffered by the good lady\'s constant babble. And the hefty Giles decides that he is unusually fortunate because he has to officiate at the ceremony of ducking the scandalmonger.The Rev. Dimmesdale strikes one as being a peculiarly spineless person, wavering between a confession of his sin and clinging to his position as minister. He is the father of Hester\'s child, and he punishes himself one night by branding the letter ""A"" on his own chest. This rô1e is acted by Lars Hanson, who, while he is indubitably sincere in his performance, occasionally appears to be too optimistic in his expression.Henry B. Walthall figures as Roger Prynne, who is supposed to have been a prisoner of the Indians for seven years, which accounts for a beard and expression mindful of Svengali. There is a stirring scene when he appears, for he is a physician who had deserted Hester soon after they were wed. He knows that her sick child is not his, but he finally concocts medicine that saves the little girl, hoping for a later vengeance on the father of the child and Hester. Here one thinks that he has little to say in the matter, considering his treatment of Hester.Karl Dane, who won his screen spurs by his performance as Slim in ""The Big Parade,"" officiates in this new picture as Giles. He does exceedingly well with the rôle.There are some cleverly pictured scenes in the church and the sights of crowds betray imaginative direction, both in the handling of the players and in their arrangement according to the shades of their costumes.']"

How the heroic, though unsuccessful movement looks to foreigners, it is difficult to ascertain, probably as a mere isolated desperate attempt on the part of a few youths to shake off the hated yoke. But the true case stands thus: in the Spring the party of action, as usual, organized a movement. When GARIBALDI went to England he and MAZZINI agreed on the plan to be followed. On GARIBALDI\'s return to Caprera he received a direct offer from the King to go to Ischia, and a promise that on the 1st of September a steamer should be in readiness to convey him and thirty of his followers to ""the East,"" in order to worry Austria from the Danublan Principalities. GARIBALDI accepted the offer, but his officers, including his own son, MENOTTE, fearing, a trap and seeing at best only an endeavor to exile the popular chief from Italy, refused to follow him, and the negotiations were broken off. Meanwhile the preparations almost completed on Venetian soil were suspended. Summer and Autumn had passed, and Winter was drawing nigh. Reluctantly, but resolutely, the central committee resident in Italy, composed of Garibaldians and Mazzinians, warned the Venetians that operations must be postponed to the Spring, alleging the inclemency of the season, the withdrawal of the tacit permission at first afforded by the powers that be, &c., &c. And the majority of the volunteers sadly acquiesced, but the brave few, weary of procrastination, believing that it needed but the match to kindle the flame, confident that if the initiative was once taken by Venetians, on Venetian soil, GARIBALDI and his volunteers would come in, and, after the first victory, be followed by the Italian army, resolved to act. Arms they possessed and some money; the desertion of some Italian soldiers from the Austrian army encouraged them and enabled them to perform prodigies of valor in the Italian mountains. Alas! Italy, absorbed in convention, transfer and financial crisis, turned a deaf ear to their appeal; the Government caused all who attempted to rush to their aid to be arrested; the mass of the Venetian population, convinced that, without aid from Italy, no movement could succeed, remained grieved but passive spectators; Austria shoots, tortures and imprisons, and the courageous band disperses. Happily, most of them succeed in gaining the frontier, and among them the leaders, TALAYYI and ANDREWZZI. Such is the genuine history of the attempt which leaves us mourning for the victims and once more hoping for the Spring.']"

It is a heavy handed narrative in which the avaricious nature of the leading character is too exaggerated to be believable.Hannah Bell (Miss Robson) delights in cutting coupons and in outwitting bankers, but she heartily dislikes buying a newspaper or paying her nickel for carfare. She even goes so far as to give an assumed name so that her boy can be taken care of in the charity ward of a hospital. The old skinflint withdraws her securities and deposit from a bank because John Burton, who is assumed to have jilted her years before, is elected vice president of the institution. She is so averse to spending money that she essays making her youngster\'s clothes.If many of the incidents are forced, Miss Robson\'s eminently satisfactory acting does cause the picture to hold one\'s attention. It is quite obvious that the crotchety, mercenary old person will at the close leave the screen with a smile and forgive her son for having married Burton\'s daughter.The picture opens in 1893 and winds up in 1907, soon after the panic. And while Hannah Bell clings to her pennies and grows wealthier as the years roll by, she occasionally unbends toward the end and signs an occasional substantial check for charity. But the miserly instincts are in her blood, and even when there is a chance to help Burton, when he has his back to the wall, she does so in such a way as to have him at her mercy.There is an episode where Hannah goes to Princeton to witness the graduation of her son, who is the valedictorian of his class. His talk is against material things, but the words fall on deaf ears so far as his mother is concerned. She has spent $10, or cashed a check for that amount, to go to the college, and although she is devoted to her boy she cannot help thinking of even that amount of money. On the way back to New York Hannah tries to take a newspaper from a passenger seated opposite her, rather than permit her son to buy one. This scene is much too lengthy. In the end Hannah gets the paper, only to find out that it is three days old.Miss Robson assuredly gives the impression of a woman with a greed for gold. As Hannah she is quick tempered and her most enjoyable hours are spent in the vault of a bank. It is a pity that the various incidents were not written and directed more deftly, for one senses that notwithstanding what has happened in real life, the doings of Hannah are exaggerated.Lewis Stone is admirable as Burton. Jean Parker is comely and capable as Burton\'s daughter. Mary Forbes is excellent as a school friend of Hannah\'s and William Bakewell is acceptable as the money-lover\'s son.May Robson is also to be seen in person as the headliner of the Capitol\'s stage show. Other numbers on this section of the program include ""Mode d\'Or,"" which is in four episodes; ""The Golden Screen,"" in the ballet corps; ""Dance Grotesque,"" with Anita Avila and Jack Niles; ""In Tango Tempo,"" with Harrison and Alex Fisher, and ""Pot Pourri,"" with the ensemble.

nyt://article/bfc535ef-7e44-584f-a8da-ca2984565cab,Success,"['Two features, one a melodrama and the other a farce-comedy, were presented last night at the Times Square Theatre. The first offering was the picturization of Max Marcin\'s play, ""Silence,"" and the other was the screen version of that old musical comedy, ""The Prince of Pilsen."" Except for the fact that the dual bill caused the entertainment to be a trifle too long, the evening was a success, and John C. Flinn, Vice President of the Producers Distributing Corporation, is to be congratulated on having a dignified first night. There were no glaring are lights, no motion picture cameras and no curious throng hindering access to the theatre.Although the pictorial conception of ""Silence"" has its theatric moments, it is none the less a decidedly effective melodrama which is exceedingly well directed. The players handle their respective rôles with sincerity and, for the most part, with restraint. The story gripped the spectators, and the only weakness was the happy ending in a sunlit garden, which, after all, followed the line of the play.H. B. Warner, who many years ago won the plaudits of multitudes in ""Alias Jimmy Valentine""—which was based on O. Henry\'s story, ""A Retrieved Reformation""—in the picture plays the same part he did on the stage in the Marcin effort. His ability before the camera is comparable to his work before the footlights. The mobility of his countenance is remarkable and it is evident that he puts his whole soul into the part, which, it will be remembered, is that of an unfortunate crook who is willing to sacrifice his life for the girl he knows to be his daughter.Twenty years elapse between certain chapters, but the first episode and the last are connected. The main story is told in the intervening passages. Jim Warren (Mr. Warner) is doomed to be hanged, and one perceives the pendulum of a clock suddenly fade out into a small noose. Then, as in the play, the incidents in Warren\'s life are unfurled, and the spectator is taken back a score of years.Vera Reynolds acts the part of the unfortunate mother and also that of the daughter. In the days of two decades ago she wears her hair long, combed back from her forehead, and as the daughter she is an up-to-date young girl. A very strong situation in this photoplay is where the condemned man, in order to drive the girl away and save her from being involved in the scandal, denounces her as a flapper seeking publicity. Here Miss Reynolds portrays the hopeless misery of a girl who imagines that her father\'s brain is unhinged.Rockliffe Fellowes, always a sympathetic performer, is seen as Phil Powers, the successful man whom the murdered crook wanted to blackmail. Jack Mulhall and Virginia Pearson deliver splendid performances in supporting parts.To lend an atmosphere of cheer following the gloom of the melodrama, the film transcription of ""The Prince of Pilsen"" was put on after the intermission. In this feature our old friend, George Sidney, known for his performances in Samuel Goldwyn\'s productions of ""Potash and Perlmutter"" and also for his work in ""The Cohens and the Kelleys,"" romps about the screen as an unwilling Prince, who, when he observes the pomp of a mythical kingdom court, imagines that he has been hurled into an European Masonic lodge. He is supposed to be a member of several lodges in Cincinnati, and he is constantly asking the foreigners whether they have ""efer been to Zinzinnati?"" He protests that he is Hans Wagner of the Ohio city, but his words fall on deaf ears, and when he is found to be an imposter he is put up against a wall to be shot.Wagner, however, does not lose his presence of mind, always believing that it is merely a test of courage. He smokes a cigar after the black band has been tied around his eyes.Prior to this scene, the sequence in which Mr. Wagner finds himself compelled, as the Prince of Pilsen, to take part in a jousting tournament is particularly humorous, especially when Mr. Wagner in a coat of mall is lifted on a horse.Anita Stewart figures as the heroine, Nellie Wagner, and Allan Forrest, looking strikingly handsome, plays the part of the real Prince of Pilsen. Myrtle Stedman has the rôle of the Princess of Thorwald, who is temporarily invalided through a sudden attack of the measles.Dr. Hugo Riesenfeld, who is credited with the presentation of ""Silence,"" officiated as the leader of the orchestra and the rendition of the familiar airs from ""The Prince of Pilsen"" was delightful.']"

American explanations that exports under P.L. 480 covered only quantities which India could not have afforded to import commercially (and thus did not cut into Thai exports) fell on deaf ears.

This hearing of the Oversight and Investigations Subcommittee of the Energy and Commerce Committee will come to order. And the chair recognizes himself for an opening statement. ""I wish we could get caught. We are such a crooked company."" Of all the words in the now famous memo our witness sent to Kenneth Lay in August of last year, these might be the most chilling. According to this morning\' witness, the person who uttered those words was a management level of Enron, a team player, a person who probably stood to lose a great deal in any financial collapse at Enron. What is the truth behind Enron\'s precipitous collapse? This morning we have before us as our sole witness Ms. Sherron Watkins, Enron\'s vice president of corporate development. Ms. Watkins has become known as the lone voice who sought to warn Enron chairman and CEO Ken Lay that Enron was in danger of imploding, quote, ""in a wave of accounting scandals."" Subsequent events have proved the truth of that unvarnished assessment. What we now understand from evidence this committee has gathered in its investigation, and the materials contained in the Powers Report, and from testimony of senior Enron officials at last week\'s hearing, that these so-called aggressive accounting practices were used to hide an even larger business failure. Last week we took testimony from two senior Enron officials, Jordan Mintz; and then treasurer, now Enron president and chief operating officer, Jeffrey McMahon. They too anguished that something was terribly wrong at Enron, but were unable to determine the full extent of the problems or the dangers ahead. Unlike them, our witness this morning was privy to substantially more evidence of the accounting practices used to hide various related party transactions between Enron and what are known as the Raptor entities -- special purpose entities owned by LJM2, the limited partnership set up and run by Enron and its former chief financial officer, Andrew Fastow. She will testify today that in her opinion these transactions were outright manipulations of Enron\'s income statements, booking fictitious income, and hiding actual losses. Ms. Watkins took her concerns right to the top. She wrote a memo to Mr. Lay on August 15th that set forth in stark terms the seriousness of Enron\'s situation and the dire consequences that would inevitably result if corrective action were not taken -- and soon. We now know that Ms. Watkins also met with Mr. Lay not just once, as had been previously disclosed, but on two additional times in late October of last year, to further share her concerns and to urge that Enron restate its income statements for the past two years, due to the deceptive transactions with the Raptor\'s special purpose entities. Yet, until the Powers Report came out two weeks ago affirming her analysis of the Raptors, no one at Enron or Andersen ever sought to address these concerns. Indeed, the actions taken by Enron in October and November of last year to revise its earnings and shareholder equity numbers still fail to address many of the concerns raised by Ms. Watkins, and confirmed by the Powers Report. Ms. Watkins also will describe today her meetings and conversations with others throughout Enron\'s corporate hierarchy, as well as with outside advisors. This included Mr. McMahon, associate general counsel Rex Rogers, vice president for human resources Cindy Olson, James Hecker (ph) -- an Enron audit partner -- and Vinson and Elkins managing partner Joe Dilg. Her initial meeting with Mr. Lay in August prompted an investigation by Vinson and Elkins, assisted by Andersen -- the very two parties Ms. Watkins urged Mr. Lay and others not to include in the review because of clear conflicts of interests. Not surprisingly, the report that Vinson and Elkins issued on October 15th was so flawed that Ms. Watkins seriously considered leaving the company. Instead she persisted in her attempts to convince Mr. Lay of the enormity of the challenge facing Enron, and the failure of outside experts to clearly state the facts. It wasn\'t until October 31st that Ms. Watkins learned that a special committee of the board of directors would examine Enron\'s questionable business practices. This investigation has since become known as the Powers inquiry. Ms. Watkins\' appearance and testimony before us today will be the first time anyone has had the opportunity to question her publicly about her own actions, and how individuals at the highest level in the company responded to her warnings. Let me point out that Ms. Watkins is not a whistle-blower in the conventional sense. She was and is a loyal company employee who sought valiantly, and sadly in vain, to get the people in charge to face the facts and make the hard choices needed to save the company. Ms. Watkins indeed is still an Enron employee, and because of this fact has requested a subpoena compelling her testimony today. I want to point out, however, that she has been responsive to and very cooperative with our investigators, and I look forward to her sharing with the subcommittee and the American public in her own words how it came to be that at the end a once faithful employee concluded that her company was cooking the books. Ms. Watkins, thank you for your help. We welcome your testimony. The chair recognizes the gentleman from Florida, Mr. Deutsch, for his opening statement. REP. PETER DEUTSCH (D-FL): Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and thank you, Ms. Watkins, for being here. You know, this is obviously our continuation of trying to understand what happened at Enron, and really looking at it and looking at the future. And I really want to take a couple of second just thanking the chairmen of the subcommittee and the full committee, but also the staff. I think our staff has really done an incredible job over the last about eight weeks or so. And this subcommittee has a long history in the Congress of looking at issues of really cases of failures, of corruption. And Chairman Dingell who led this subcommittee for so many years created almost a historic reputation for this subcommittee, and I believe that this hearing and this process that we are doing is part of that. I have tried to put in perspective what we are doing and where we hope to lead. And it\'s not just an investigation for an investigation\'s sake. But I think all of us at this point -- we know a lot more than we knew a week ago, a lot more than two weeks ago, that the issues I think are much broader than just Enron. The issues really our capital systems and the transparency in the accounting system. And I think what we all understand is that our economy, which is the strongest economy in the history of the world, one of the reasons that we have that economy is transparency in the capital markets and the public accounting system. And I don\'t think there\'s a question that totally abysmally failed in the case of Enron. I mean, I think it\'s factually accurate that it filed; that trying to understand Enron from its public documents I think was close to impossible. Those documents did not fairly represent the actual state of the company. And, you know, the secretary of the Treasury when Enron initially filed for bankruptcy said that, Well, this is not a big deal -- companies go bankrupt, they don\'t go bankrupt -- they\'re successful, they\'re not. I take great exception to that. There have been several major companies in America that have gone bankrupt since Enron -- Kmart has gone bankrupt, Global Crossing has gone bankrupt. But I mean there is a fundamental difference. The public markets knew what was going on in those companies -- it was transparent. It was reflected in equity value. People could understand what was going on. In the case of Enron, that was not the case. The seventh largest company in America vaporized in literally a matter of weeks, and the house of cards fell. And as we are looking at transaction after transaction after transaction, and again the number at this point, our understanding is there were 4,000 of these partnerships, and the Raptors were probably the largest, but just a several -- that the method seemed to be continuously used again and again. I guess the concern we have -- and I have -- but I think all my colleagues share is, number one: You know, How do we protect our capital markets from, number one, this never happening again, because I think that\'s clearly our goal, that when people try to understand public companies they can understand -- that\'s the whole point. But, number two, who else is doing this? And obviously I don\'t think you\'re going to be able to tell us that today. But I think that is clearly a critical component that you, as someone who was watching what was going on, understood what was going on. And if there are other companies out there that are out there doing this, obviously people in those companies know it as well. And I guess one of the things that hopefully will happen is that it will immediately be reflected in statements and their filings to the SEC. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. REP. GREENWOOD: The chair thanks the gentleman and recognizes the chairman of the full committee, the gentleman from Louisiana, Mr. Tauzin, for an opening statement. REP. BILLY TAUZIN (R-LA): Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Let me first thank you, Mr. Chairman, and the incredible work of the Democratic and Republican joint investigatory staff. You have done I think our country a great service, and you continue to do so with these hearings, and I deeply appreciate -- I know I speak for all the members -- your personal commitment to this task. Let me first observe that as a result of these hearings and the incredible new information that our witness will provide us with today, I think America is learning what went wrong at Enron. More importantly, corporate execs across America are reassessing -- corporate management and board members across America are beginning to ask hard questions and to become significantly more involved and concerned in the operations of their companies. The SEC has announced its planned reforms. FASB has announced planned reforms. This committee and the committee that we assigned the job of jurisdiction over FASB and the accounting standards in America, chaired by Cliff Stearns of Florida, is beginning the process of recommending legislation to our full committee. Yesterday the subcommittee on Energy of our committee examined the aspects of the Enron collapse on the energy markets of America, and we are investigating allegations of potential damage done. Generally the news is good -- the energy markets held up -- electricity flowed, gas flowed. Somehow companies worked around the financial collapse of Enron and continued to deliver energy at reasonable prices, in fact lower prices, to the American public during this crisis. And today we will hear from an officer of the Enron Corporation who really knew and who really understood who the culprits were within her own company, and who did her best to make sure that those in control of her company, if they had been kept in the dark, were no longer in the dark, and understood the problems the company faced. There is a doctrine in law called the last clear chance. It\'s a doctrine that says that even if you are totally in the right on the highway, if you had the last clear chance to avoid the accident you can still be responsible for what happened. Our witness today will talk about how she attempted to give the leadership at Enron a last clear chance -- not just to do what was right in correcting its filings with the American public and the investors in this company, but to do what was right in getting rid of culprits, in assigning responsibility, in accepting responsibility, and in correcting the problems, in the hope that there was still a chance to save the corporation from the bankruptcy it now faces. We will learn whether the company took that last clear chance. I don\'t think there\'s anything more prophetic in the document we have now received from our witness describing her evaluation of the culprits, of what happened, who was responsible for it, and what had to be done if the company was going to have a chance to be saved. In the last paragraphs of that memo which our witness handed Mr. Ken Lay on October 30th, I quote: ""My conclusions if Ken Lay takes these steps. The bad news: this is horrific. Plaintiff attorneys will be celebrating. The trouble facing the company will be obvious to all. The good news: while speculations will slow down, if not cease, nobody wants Ken Lay\'s head. He is very well respected in business and the community."" And then she identifies the culprits. The culprits are Skilling, Fastow, Glisson, Causey as well as Arthur Andersen and V&E. In the final paragraph we find, ""My conclusions if we don\'t come clean and restate, all these bad things will happen to us anyway -- it\'s just that Ken Lay will be more implicated in this than is deserved, and he won\'t get the chance, I might add, the last clear chance, to restore the company to its former stature."" What we are learning, and what will be confirmed today, I believe, by this witness, is that we have witnessed an incredible -- an incredible collection of not only miscreants and potential criminal behavior, but a series of abuses of accounting standards and practices, a series of abuses of the American public investing -- the investing public in and its confidence in this company, and its knowledge about its income and it debt, abuse that led to a horrible loss to its employees, not only of their jobs but of their pensions, and abuses that have rocked Wall Street and the investment communities and the corporate boards of America. If there is any good news in all this, it\'s that we\'re finding out what went wrong. We\'re really getting to the bottom of it, and we\'re learning how we might turn the corner and begin to make improvements in our laws and our rules to help make sure that no other company experiences this again. But there is other good news, and I say this with deep appreciation, Ms. Watkins, it\'s the knowledge that there are people like you in this world who are willing to try to make it right, who understand their fiduciary responsibility to their company, and are willing to go out on the limb as you did to make sure that people who could make a difference, who could change things, who could make it right, and who could save that company, did have at least a last great chance to do it. And there\'s one other good news. And I have a perspective that I think more and more members are beginning at least to share. There may be other problems in other companies in America -- this is incredibly an aberration. I have never in all of the years of watching companies succeed and fail and bankruptcies -- and there have been some might big bankruptcies in this country -- seen anything like this. When we are through examining it and responding to it, I think the American public will be well-served by the process of learning from this experience and the changes we are going to make. And the witness who comes before us will deserve again the appreciation of the American public for doing what she did, and for standing out the way she has. I deeply appreciate you being here, Ms. Watkins. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. REP. GREENWOOD: The chair thanks the gentleman. And before recognizing the ranking member of the full committee, would announce that we have apparently two votes before us now. So, after Mr. Dingell\'s opening remarks, we will recess and make these two votes and come back. REP. JOHN DINGELL (D-MI): I\'m willing to do it whichever way you like, Mr. Chairman -- go no, or go later. REP. GREENWOOD: Well, I would welcome the gentleman\'s opening statement now -- REP. DINGELL: Very well. REP. GREENWOOD: -- and the other members are free to go. REP. DINGELL: Mr. Chairman, thank you for holding this hearing. And I commend you and the committee for continuing the investigation into the actions that caused Enron, once the seventh largest company in the country, to become the largest bankruptcy in the history of the country. Each hearing that we have held, and I expect we will be holding more, reveals more of the internal corruption that destroyed Enron, as corruption swept in Enron\'s top management as well as its in-house and outside accountants and lawyers, all of whom reviewed and approved the transactions that we discussed today. All of them apparently knew that Enron was pledging its stock to guarantee its own hedges with an alleged outside party. This is clearly a violation of all accounting procedures and principles, and apparently one that the Houston office of Arthur Andersen approved over the opposition of its Chicago office. It led directly to a $1.1 billion reduction in Enron\'s equity, and a $700,000 reduction in earnings. These same people knew that a partnership run by Enron\'s chief financial officer, who was benefitting greatly from these transaction. All of them, and an unquestioning board of directors did nothing. I want to thank Ms. Watkins for the heroic efforts she made to help Enron avoid this, in her own words, ""implosion and a wave of accounting scandals."" Ms. Watkins took the actions that should have been taken months before by many others both inside and outside of Enron with fiduciary duties to the company and to its shareholders. I think we should applaud her. It is never easy to be a whistleblower, particularly in a company where the mentality did not encourage negative news and negative views. Bearers of bad news are often punished. Today we are going to concentrate on the Raptor transactions, which have been described by the report of the special committee as extremely complex Raptor (?) structured finance vehicles designed to allow Enron to avoid reflecting losses in the value of some merchant investments on its income statement. We cannot fully understand the structure of the vehicles, but we know they are breathtaking in scope, and breathtaking -- (inaudible) -- and in the impact they had. These four vehicles resulted in a write-down of equity, the restatement of earnings, and a credit reduction that sank Enron. Although the Raptors were supposed to take the risk of losses in merchant investments, they actually were guaranteed by Enron stock and used the appreciation in Enron stock value to increase earnings. This is a violation of all basic accounting principles. The accounting shenanigans that permitted such returns were instigated and/or approved by Andrew Fastow, Enron\'s chief financial officer, Richard Causey, Enron\'s chief accounting officer, Rick Buy, Enron\'s chief risk management officer, Arthur Andersen and by Vinson & Elkins, Enron\'s outside counsel. The Raptors also benefitted greatly LJM-II, a special purpose entity run by Mr. Fastow. Although they were supposed to hedge potential losses in some of Enron\'s merchant investments, they actually repaid LJM-II\'s owner investment some generous returns with Enron taking the total risk. As described in an LJM-II presentation to its partners in October of 2000, Raptor-3, for example, paid out $41 million on a $30 million investment in just eight days. This is an amazing 2,503 percent annual return for those investors. I think it\'s important to note for the record, Mr. Chairman, that Mr. Fastow, Mr. Causey, Mr. Buy, and Arthur Andersen have all been removed from their positions -- perhaps too late, but they have anyway. But Enron has supported Vinson & Elkins, which approved every single one of these deals for Enron, and then -- (inaudible) -- Ms. Watkins\' allegations in a report, finding not a single transaction with LJM was contrary to Enron\'s best interests to this day. The law firm\'s written report was issued just one day before Enron announced its equity write-down and earnings and reductions based on the very Raptor transactions that Mr. Watkins brought to Kenneth Lay\'s attention. I think it would be quite appropriate to devote a hearing to the role Enron\'s legal counsel played in this fiasco that took $70 billion from the pockets of unsuspecting shareholders and employees. And I note that their role in this does not credit to the profession of which I take pride in being a part. But today I look forward to hearing from an extraordinary, courageous woman, who has been a bright spot in an otherwise sorry and outrageous saga. Ms. Watkins, we thank you. Mr. Chairman, I thank you. REP. GREENWOOD: The chair thanks the gentlemen, and the committee will recess for approximately 20 minutes. (Recess.) REP. GREENWOOD: The committee will come to order. And the chair recognizes the gentleman from Florida, Mr. Stearns, for an opening statement. REP. CLIFF STEARNS (R-FL): Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And Ms. Watkins, obviously, like other members, I\'d like to take the opportunity to welcome you to our committee and pleased that you\'re willing to testify. Your status is perhaps not, as the press might outline, that you\'re a whistleblower. You\'re not the traditional whistleblower in the sense that you\'re still working for the company. And the way you did it was commendable in the sense that you went to different people and talked to them and you asked for a transfer to another part of the company. But in sort of a semantic way, you\'re not a whistleblower in the traditional sense. I\'m not sure if we have a word which describes when you complain and you stay within the company and work as you did, but it, I think, was very effective and helpful for us. I believe that employees such as yourself, in no small measure, contribute to the integrity of our commercial system by insisting that all participants play by the rules. And I think all Americans thank you for what you did. Secondly, I want to explore a number of substantive issues which you raise in your August 15th, 2001 memo to Mr. Lay that touched upon the efficacy of our financial accounting standards. As part of the full committee\'s Enron investigation, Chairman Tauzin has asked my subcommittee, which is Commerce, Trade & Consumer Protection, to examine our accounting standards in light of the Enron collapse. As a matter of fact, my subcommittee just concluded a hearing which examined the adequacy and responsiveness of existing accounting standards. I believe, as it seems, you may believe also, when you wrote the memo to Mr. Lay, that there is ample evidence that Enron, at a minimum, confused, obfuscated its true financial health from the investing public by using or possibly misusing financial accounting standards. I now think there is enough evidence to suggest that Enron did not use special-purpose entities such as Raptor as generally accepted accounting principles would authorize it, but they used it to hide poor-performing merchant investments so that Enron would not have to show the declining values that existed on their income statement. Moreover, it appears that Enron reported the transfer of assets to SPEs as a sale and recognized them as such in its income statement, while it held the third-party investors in the SPE harmless against the risk associated with those assets by pledging its stock as collateral. I believe this is what you alluded to in your memo when you wrote, and I\'m quoting, quote, ""If adequately explained, the investor would know that the entities described in our related-party footnote"" -- and I assume you meant footnote number 16 of Enron\'s 2000 annual report -- ""are thinly-capitalized. The equity-holders have no skin in the game, and all the value in the entities come from underlying values of the derivative."" Unfortunately, in this case, there was a big loss in Enron stock (and NP?). So during the question-and-answer period, I hope we can further explore that. Again, thank you very much for testifying. REP. GREENWOOD: The chair thanks the gentleman and would urge each of the members, if they could, to keep their opening remarks to as brief as possible so we can move forward with the witness, in view of the fact that we have votes and members will be leaving. The chair recognizes the gentleman, Mr. Stupak, for an opening statement. REP. BART STUPAK (D-MI): Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I want to thank you, Ms. Watkins, for coming here today. Many of my colleagues and I truly appreciate your brave actions in informing Mr. Lay about the shady accounting that was going on in Enron. It\'s a shame that he and others on the board and in leadership positions at Enron did not see these problems much earlier. Even now, there\'s a denial and a lack of acceptability of responsibility by Enron officials in all the hearings we\'ve had thus far to date. It\'s also a shame that even after you provided Mr. Lay with a road map of what was going on in Enron, as the Powers report put it, they decided to hire inside counsel to do the investigation into the allegations. That counsel, Vinson & Elkins, was the very law firm that was responsible for providing advice on many of the questionable transactions. It was no surprise that Vinson & Elkins, in summarizing their findings, stated that Ms. Watkins\' concerns were thoroughly investigated but, quoting now, ""found not to raise new or undisclosed information,"" end of quote. Mr. Chairman, we know that once a truly independent firm, one from outside the Enron family, was allowed to review the transactions, they came to a very different conclusion. Ms. Watkins, you mentioned in your interview with committee staff that when you met with Mr. Lay to discuss your memo, you felt like the child who tells the emperor that he has no clothes. (Inaudible) -- the emperor\'s new clothes. And while you\'re to be commended for coming forward in August of 2001, there was another emperor, Jeffrey Skilling, who was running Enron prior to your August 15th letter. And I have a feeling he knew he had no clothes, and that is why or that is what prompted his resignation. I\'d like to take just a moment to read you, if I may, the final page of Hans Christian Andersen\'s story. I don\'t believe he\'s any relation to Arthur Andersen. (Laughter.) But the last page of the story goes like this. It says, ""The emperor shivered, for it seemed they were right. But what could he do? After all, he was the emperor, and people expected him to be dignified. \'I must continue to end the procession,\' he thought, so the empire"" -- the emperor, excuse me -- ""the emperor stood up, just as tall, and his servants went on carrying the train that wasn\'t there."" Mr. Chairman, reading this, I can\'t help but think of our last hearing last week with Mr. Skilling and his own parade and his servants, Mr. Winokur and Jaedicke, following behind him, carrying his non-existent robe. I know we\'re anxious to hear Ms. Watkins\' testimony, so I\'m going to take your advice and look forward to answering the questions that will be put to you today. So, Mr. Chairman, with that, I\'ll yield back my time. REP. GREENWOOD: The chair thanks the gentleman and thanks him for not showing the picture of the unclothed emperor. (Laughter.) The chair recognizes the gentleman from North Carolina, Mr. Burr, for an opening statement. REP. RICHARD BURR (R-NC): I thank the chairman. Mr. Chairman, we have before us today a witness who I believe can provide the most insight and helpful testimony we have yet to hear in piecing together this affair. With her background as a CPA and a former employee of Andersen, many have described Sherron Watkins as being unique in her ability to bring light on this charade. I\'d add one more uniqueness about Ms. Watkins that was lacking in all the other individuals who have chosen to come before this committee to stop the bleeding at Enron -- a moral compass. In her now famous August memo, she brought to light what she saw as accounting improprieties, most noticeably in the Raptor transactions. Today she will share with us her observations and concerns that she raised with Enron executives, most noticeably Ken Lay, concerns that fell on deaf ears at the top of the company, while simultaneously this one-time giant fell to its knees. Mr. Chairman, I could detail what others have done. I think what best details the situation at Enron were the list of songs by the Texas native who just passed away, Waylon Jennings. One song might be, ""I Ain\'t Livin\' Long Like This."" ""Wanted: The Outlaws."" ""Mama, Don\'t Let Your Babies Grow Up To Be Cowboys,"" or just ""Some Good Old Boys."" And Andersen could best be described as ""Are You Sure Hank Done It That Way?"" However, Waylon\'s ballad, ""A Good-Hearted Woman,"" could better describe the witness we have before us today. In all seriousness, thank you, Sherron, for appearing before us. You\'re doing this committee and your fellow Enron employees a great service. In the New Testament, when Peter stepped out of the boat and walked on water, the miracle wasn\'t the fact that he walked on water. No, the miracle was that he chose to put his faith in God and step out of the boat, a boat which was his protection but was bound to sink in troubled water. Thank you for choosing to step out of the boat today. I yield back. REP. GREENWOOD: The chair thanks the gentleman and recognizes himself for 10 minutes for questions. Ms. Watkins, when you and I -- oh, I\'m sorry. I\'m sorry. It\'s a good thing we have staff here. Ms. Watkins, you\'re aware that this committee is holding an investigative hearing. And when holding an investigative hearing, it is our practice to take testimony under oath. Do you have any objections to taking your testimony under -- giving your testimony under oath today? MS. WATKINS: No, I don\'t. REP. GREENWOOD: Okay. Do you -- the chair advises you that under the rules of this committee and the rules of the House, you are entitled to be advised by counsel. Do you choose to be advised by counsel today? MS. WATKINS: Yes, I do. REP. GREENWOOD: And would you identify your counsel for me? MS. WATKINS: Mr. Philip Hilder. REP. GREENWOOD: Okay. Sir, would you spell your last name? MR. HILDER: Hilder, sir -- H-I-L-D-E-R. REP. GREENWOOD: Thank you. In that case, if you would please rise and raise your right hand, I\'ll give you the oath. Do you swear that the testimony you are about to give is the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth? MS. WATKINS: I do. REP. GREENWOOD: Okay. Be seated. You are under oath, and you are recognized for your opening remarks. You\'ll probably want to pull that microphone over to you, and it\'s fairly directional. MS. WATKINS: Okay. Good morning, Mr. Chairman, members of the subcommittee. I\'m Sherron Watkins. And thank you for the opportunity to address the subcommittee this morning. REP. GREENWOOD: Pull it up a little closer and speak right into it. There you go. MS. WATKINS: I\'m currently employed at Enron Corporation as a vice president. By way of background, I hold a master\'s degree in professional accounting from the University of Texas at Austin, and I have been a certified public accountant since 1983. I began my career in 1982 at Arthur Andersen as an auditor. I spent eight years at Andersen in both the Houston and New York offices. I joined New York-based MG Trade Finance in 1990 to manage their portfolio of commodity-backed finance assets. I held that position until October of 1993. In October of 1993, I was hired by Mr. Andrew Fastow and moved back to Houston to manage Enron\'s newly-formed partnership with CALPERS, the California Public Employee Retirement System. The partnership was the Joint Energy Development Investments Limited Partnership, or JEDI. I held the JEDI management portfolio position until the end of 1996. From 1997 until early 2000, I worked for Enron International, primarily in the Mergers & Acquisitions Group, which is also known as the Corporate Development Group. In early 2000, I transferred to Enron Broad-Band Services. I worked there until June of 2000 in a variety of roles. In mid to late June of 2001, I went to work directly for Mr. Fastow, assisting in the corporate development work that had been put under his supervision after Cliff Baxter resigned in May of 2001. I worked for Mr. Fastow in this new role into late August 2001. I have since been reassigned into the Human Resources Group, with a variety of assignments. While working for Mr. Fastow in 2001, I was charged with reviewing all assets that Enron considered for sale and determining the likely economic impact of sale. As part of the sale analysis, I reviewed the estimated book values and market values of each asset. A number of assets were hedged with an entity called Raptor. Any asset that was hedged should, for the most part, have a locked-in sales value for Enron, meaning that despite current market prices, Enron should realize the hedged price of the Raptor. It was my understanding that the Raptor special-purpose entities were owned by LJM, a partnership run by Mr. Fastow. In completing my work, certain Enron business units provided me with analyses that showed certain of the hedged losses that had been incurred by Raptor were actually coming back to Enron. The general explanation was that the Enron -- (inaudible) -- the Raptor hedge had declined in value such that Raptor would have a shortfall and would be unable to fully cover the hedge price that it owed Enron. I was highly alarmed by the information I was receiving. My understanding as an accountant is that a company could never use its own stock to generate a gain or avoid a loss on its income statement. I continued to ask questions and seek answers, primarily from former co-workers in the Global Finance Group or in the business units that had hedged assets with Raptor. I never heard reassuring explanations. I was not comfortable confronting either Mr. Skilling or Mr. Fastow with my concerns. To do so, I believe, would have been a job- terminating move. On August 14th, 2001, I was informed of Mr. Skilling\'s sudden resignation, and felt compelled to inform Mr. Lay of the accounting problems that faced Enron. I sent Mr. Lay an anonymous letter on August 14th, 2001, in response to a request for questions for an upcoming all-employee meeting to be held August 16th, to address Mr. Skilling\'s departure. At the all-employee meeting, Mr. Lay commented that our visions and values had slipped, and that if any employee was troubled by anything at Enron, please bring those concerns to him or any number of the top management, including Cindy Olson, Steve Kane and others. On August 16th I met with Ms. Olson to show her a copy of the letter and discuss it with her. She encouraged me to meet with Mr. Lay personally. Since Mr. Lay was traveling through the rest of the week, she said the meeting would probably take place the week of August 20th. I was concerned that Mr. Lay was planning to fill the Office of the Chair over the weekend, and that he might choose Mr. Fastow or Rick Causey, the chief accounting officer. To voice my concerns, I met with Rex Rogers, Enron\'s associate general counsel on Friday, August 17th, 2001. I provided Mr. Rogers with a version of the anonymous letter, as well as two additional memos, all of which are part of the seven pages that this committee discovered in mid June 2002 -- I mean, January 2002. On Monday, August 20th, 2001, Mr. Lay\'s assistant scheduled a meeting for me to meet with Mr. Lay that following Wednesday, August 22nd, 2001. I subsequently held discussions with a former mentor at Andersen, James Hecker (sp), and a long-time friend and co-worker, Jeffrey McMahon, to vet my concerns before my meeting with Mr. Lay. I met with Mr. Lay on the afternoon of Wednesday, August 22nd, 2001. The meeting lasted just over one half hour. I provided him with five memos I had drafted to help explain the problems facing the company. These five memos constitute the seven pages this committee discovered and subsequently disclosed on January 14th, 2002. Additionally, I provided Mr. Lay an analysis of the Raptor entity economics and a presentation prepared by Enron\'s risk assessment and control group. I primarily used the memo titled ""Summary of Raptor Oddities"" as talking points with Mr. Lay. My main point to Mr. Lay was that by this time Raptor owed Enron in excess of $700 million under certain hedging agreements. My understanding was that the Raptor entities basically had no other business aside from these hedges; therefore, they had collectively lost over $700 million. I urged Mr. Lay to find out who lost that money. If he discovered that this loss would be borne by Enron shareholders, via an issuance of stock in the future, then I thought we had a very large problem on our hands. I gave Mr. Lay my opinion that it is never appropriate for a company to use its stock to affect its income statement. At the conclusion of the meeting, Mr. Lay assured me that he would look into my concerns. I also requested a transfer, as I was uncomfortable remaining as a direct report to Mr. Fastow. I intend to fully cooperate with the subcommittee, and I now welcome the opportunity to answer any questions the members may have at this time. REP. GREENWOOD: Thank you very much for your testimony, Ms. Watkins. And we all thank you again for being here. The chair recognizes himself for 10 minutes for inquiry. Ms. Watkins, when we spoke yesterday you described that in your earlier days working for Mr. Fastow the special purpose entities were basically legitimate; they seemed to be garden variety securitized entities that were designed to do legitimate -- serve legitimate financial purposes, with which you had no qualms. And as you described -- and I think Condor was one of those early SPEs that fit that category. As you described your time with the company, it seemed to me that it was like the story of the frog and the pot on the stove: that gradually, largely directed by Mr. Fastow, I understand, the rules of the game began to change, and the legitimacy of these entities and partnerships began to be stretched, till finally we end up with something like the Raptors, which seem to serve no legitimate -- and perhaps not even a legal -- purpose. And it seemed to me that the difficulty was that the corporate culture was slowly acclimated to this transition from what was quite legitimate to what was clearly not legitimate. Let me ask you this specific question: Is it your opinion that the Raptor transactions then were nothing more than sheer income statement manipulation? And if you do think that, why do you say so? MS. WATKINS: That is my opinion, and it is my opinion because true economic risk was not passed to a third party. Raptor owed Enron in excess of $700 million, and there was not an outside third party that bore that loss. It was going to be borne by Enron shareholders by an issuance of stock in the future. REP. GREENWOOD: Explain how that affected the income statements. MS. WATKINS: Well, the -- Raptor was hedging with -- REP. GREENWOOD: Again, if you would pull the microphone a little closer -- the silver one is the one that actually broadcasts into the room here. MS. WATKINS: The Raptor hedges were locking in supposedly sales value that Enron had on equity investments that it had made. The investments that were probably the more volatile was a tech investment in Avichi (ph) and the new power company, a start-up that Enron had done. Those investments were hedged with Raptor. They had dropped significantly in value. And in the related-party footnote in 2000, it mentions that Enron had recognized $500 million of revenue from the special entities, offsetting a corresponding write-down in the equity investment portfolio of Enron. I think that tended to make readers think that it was a $500 million gain, offset by a $500 million loss; therefore zero impact on the income statement. However, without the Raptor transactions Enron would have had a $500 million loss, not covered by any gains, running through the 2000 income statement. REP. GREENWOOD: As you came to understand this, prior to your meeting, your first meeting with Mr. Lay, did you discuss these concerns with other employees at Enron? MS. WATKINS: As I was doing my work and looking at these Raptor -- these assets hedged by Raptor, my concern was that it seemed to be just common knowledge that the Raptor losses were backstopped by Enron stock. And an analysis was always looked at -- what\'s the value of Enron stock compared to the money Raptor owes us? And I was shocked that people could explain this to me with no concern in their voice, like there was some magic structure that Enron and Andersen had come up with to make this work. REP. GREENWOOD: And did it seem to be -- did you get the impression, or was it said to you others that they thought that this was perfectly legitimate, or that it was shaky but everyone is going along with the deal? MS. WATKINS: There were people like Mr. McMahon and others that had expressed concerns about LJM and the transactions Enron was doing with LJM. But for the most part people seemed to think there was some accounting rule that was allowing this to be acceptable. It was very common knowledge. It wasn\'t hidden. REP. GREENWOOD: Did you watch Mr. Skilling\'s testimony before this subcommittee last week? MS. WATKINS: Yes, I did. REP. GREENWOOD: Would you care to comment on how you reacted as you heard Mr. Skilling describe his awareness or lack of awareness or understanding of these transactions? MS. WATKINS: Well, I would like to use Mr. Skilling\'s own words to describe what I thought about his testimony. He was interviewed by Enron\'s in-house newsletter in 2001. In the interview Mr. Skilling was asked, What\'s the best advice you ever received? And his reply was, ""If it doesn\'t make any sense, don\'t believe it."" (Laughter.)\' REP. GREENWOOD: Did you confront Mr. Skilling himself with this concern? MS. WATKINS: No, sir, I did not. REP. GREENWOOD: Why did you not? MS. WATKINS: I did not want to do that without the safety net of a job in hand. I felt like it would be an immediate job-terminating move. Frankly I thought it would be fruitless, that nothing would happen. REP. GREENWOOD: And what led you to -- did you have other experiences or were there experiences of others that led you to believe that that might be -- that you might be putting your job on the line if you were to confront Mr. Skilling -- or Mr. Fastow for that matter -- with these concerns? MS. WATKINS: Basically it appeared that the Raptor transactions had been going on for a number of years. My understanding was that Mr. Skilling was fully aware of them. He is a very hands-on manager. I had also heard rumors that people as close to him as Mr. Baxter had complained to him and he had done nothing. So I really felt it was fruitless to go to Mr. Skilling. REP. GREENWOOD: Do you think it\'s possible that Mr. Skilling was unaware of the natures of these transactions? MS. WATKINS: No, I do not. REP. GREENWOOD: Could you tell us why that\'s not possible? He seemed to have forgotten about them. MS. WATKINS: He is a very much intense, hands-on manager. He was very involved in Mr. Fastow\'s endeavors, and I find it very hard to believe that he was not fully aware of transactions with Mr. Fastow\'s partnerships. REP. GREENWOOD: Now, did Mr. Fastow learn that yo had communicated your concerns to Mr. Lay? MS. WATKINS: I did find out that he found out that I was the writer of the anonymous letter, and that I had also met with Mr. Lay. I found that out August 30th, 2001. REP. GREENWOOD: And how did he respond? Did he name you employee of the month? (Laughter.) MS. WATKINS: Well, Ms. Olson told me that she and Ken Lay were both highly alarmed by Mr. Fastow\'s reaction: he wanted to have me fired, he wanted to seize my computer. REP. GREENWOOD: Wanted to have you fire? He told people he wanted to have you fired? MS. WATKINS: That\'s what Ms. Olson told me. REP. GREENWOOD: Okay. And he wanted your computer? MS. WATKINS: Yes. REP. GREENWOOD: And did he obtain your computer? MS. WATKINS: Ms. -- he did, but Ms. Olson basically said, Let me send you to your office with an IT person -- here\'s a new laptop -- transfer whatever files you want to on the new one -- delete whatever ones you want to on the old one -- we\'ll just hand him the hardware. She said, You don\'t mind doing that, do you? And I said, No, I don\'t. (Laughter.) REP. GREENWOOD: So you pulled a fast one on Andy. Let\'s get to your face-to-face meeting with Mr. Lay. Could you describe how he reacted and what your impression of his reaction is, and particularly with regard to what extent it seemed to you, based on his comments, his reactions, that the news that you were bringing to him was surprising or not surprising, was alarming or not alarming, and to what extent it seemed to you that he had an appropriate response that would have convinced you or given you some comfort that he was in fact going to deal with this? MS. WATKINS: Well, he -- he tried to put me at ease. He knew this was probably difficult for me to do, and he recognized that. I handed him my set of documents, and directed him to the Summary of Raptor Oddities document as a talking point. He seemed to take it very seriously. In fact, when he read the quote that I put in that memo about the manager-level employees saying, ""We\'re such a crooked company,"" he winced. You know, that seemed a painful comment to him. He was aware that these Raptor transactions had been presented to the board. But I -- I said my understanding of the way these things are generally presented -- it\'s high-level summaries, and I am not so certain that the true nature was fully disclosed. And he contended that I might be right. And by the end of the discussion he certainly said he would look into it and order an investigation, and ask me what would -- what could he do for me, which was when I requested the transfer out of Mr. Fastow\'s group. REP. GREENWOOD: Okay, my time has expired. The chair thanks the recognizes for gentleman Mr. Dingell for 10 minutes for purposes of inquiry. REP. DINGELL: Mr. Chairman, I thank you. Again, I commend you. Ms. Watkins, I want to commend you also. I hope you\'ll understand these questions are friendly, but our time is limited so I therefore have to ask them in a way that gives you an opportunity to answer where possible yes or no. I will be working from a document which is entitled ""Outlines of Points to Discuss with Ken Lay and Jim Derrick."" Ms. Watkins, you specifically asked that Vinson and Elkins not do this investigation. That was because they had approved many of the LJM deals as attorney for Enron, is that correct? MS. WATKINS: Yes sir, it is. REP. DINGELL: Now, I want to refer you to the document that I have just mentioned. This is a document which was prepared by Vinson & Elkins on the result of their investigation. And Jim Derrick is Enron\'s general counsel, is he not? MS. WATKINS: Yes, he is. REP. DINGELL: Ms. Watkins -- and in this document it says that Jim Derrick decided not to engage and independent accountant, as you had recommended. Is that correct? MS. WATKINS: Yes. REP. DINGELL: The caveat on the investigation was that they should not second-guess the accounting treatment, they would not do a detailed transaction analysis, and there would be no discovery-style investigation. Did you know that at this particular time or at some later time? MS. WATKINS: I was not aware that the investigation was being limited. I met with Vinson & Elkins on September 10th for roughly three hours and had no indication that it was a limited investigation. I only discovered that it was limited when I -- when I read their October 15th response, which was not provided to me -- read it off of this committee\'s webpage. REP. DINGELL: It is fair to say that this then was not much of an investigation, was it? MS. WATKINS: I don\'t think so. REP. DINGELL: Vinson & Elkins said that with all these caveats, there was no problem except a cosmetic one, is that correct? MS. WATKINS: That is what they concluded. REP. DINGELL: And on page seven, Vinson & Elkins tells Ken Lay that Enron\'s stock is being used to support transactions with Condor and Raptor. Enron was getting earnings through derivative transactions with Raptor when it could be argued that there was no third party involved, and because of the falling value of both Enron\'s stock and asset value, the question was raised as to who bears the loss. These are exactly the same questions you had asked earlier, isn\'t that so? MS. WATKINS: Yes sir. REP. DINGELL: Now, then Vinson & Elkins says at page eight of the document, notwithstanding these bad cosmetics, Enron representatives uniformly stated that Condor Raptor vehicles were -- (inaudible) -- useful vehicles that benefitted Enron. What this says to me is that everyone -- Vinson & Elkins, Ken Lay, Jim Derrick, and all the people they interviewed knew that these were not special purpose vehicles that bore risk, is that correct? MS. WATKINS: It would appear to be so, yes. REP. DINGELL: And they knew that they were in bad financial shape, did they not? MS. WATKINS: Yes. REP. DINGELL: And they had approved them, had they not? MS. WATKINS: Yes. REP. DINGELL: So, when high level officials say they didn\'t know about those vehicles, can that be true? MS. WATKINS: No. They knew about they vehicles. REP. DINGELL: No, what do you think all these people expected to happen at this point in September 2001? MS. WATKINS: I think what\'s -- what\'s interesting to note is that it says here the ""Raptor vehicles were clever, useful vehicles that benefitted Enron."" I think that there was an understanding that Andersen and Vinson & Elkins had blessed these things, that -- you know, when I met with Rex Rogers on August 17th, he said, ""Sherron, how could you possibly be right? I mean, Andersen and Vinson & Elkins would not risk their firms giving us wrong advice. They\'ve blessed these structures."" And so I -- I think that certain people at Enron thought that these were complex but clever and that they were legitimate. REP. DINGELL: So, now -- so here we have a situation where Vinson & Elkins does -- I think they had to -- some kind of due diligence or gave legal advice to Enron on these matters, is that not so? MS. WATKINS: Yes sir. REP. DINGELL: The accountant was in a similar position, both as accountant and as consultant, is that not so? MS. WATKINS: Yes, that\'s right. REP. DINGELL: So, am I fair in inferring from this that their statements about the character of these devices as being of benefit to Enron was in error? MS. WATKINS: Well, a benefit to Enron, if you consider that we were meeting financial statement targets that we had told investor- analysts, but you can\'t meet those targets falsely. REP. DINGELL: So, they were -- they were essentially represented as being of benefit in the meeting of targets which could not be met? MS. WATKINS: Yes sir. REP. DINGELL: Mr. Chairman, in the interests of time, I would like to just ask unanimous consent to introduce the document to which I have referred. And again, Ms. Watkins, you are a women of extraordinary courage. We thank you for your assistance. REP. GREENWOOD: Without objection, the document to which the gentleman from Michigan refers, and all of the other documents in the binder will be made a part of the record. The chair recognizes the gentleman, Mr. Tauzin. REP. TAUZIN: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. First, Ms. Watkins, I apologize that we scheduled this hearing on Valentine\'s Day. I want to wish you Happy Valentine\'s. MS. WATKINS: Thanks. REP. TAUZIN: I want to refer specifically to the document which you handed Ken Lay on October the 30th. That document has been widely publicized in the last several days. Some have characterized it as an attempt to describe a public relations effort to help the company through this problem. I want you to tell me whether the facts outlined in that document are, to your best knowledge and belief, true. MS. WATKINS: Yes sir. I was providing this to Mr. Lay as a concept on public relations, however, I felt it was a truthful public relations strategy in it was something I felt should be -- should be said. REP. TAUZIN: So that the things you recommended that Mr. Lay say and do are based upon facts in this document that you believe to be true? MS. WATKINS: Yes. I do believe that Mr. Skilling and Mr. Fastow, along with two very well respected firms, did dupe Ken Lay and the board. REP. TAUZIN: Most specifically you say that. You say that as CEO, Mr. Lay relied upon his COO, Mr. Skilling, as well as CFO Fastow, and CAO Causey, to manage the details. Is that correct? MS. WATKINS: Yes. REP. TAUZIN: Is that accurate? Did Mr. -- was Mr. Skilling expected to manage the details of these transactions? MS. WATKINS: From all the records and the presentations that I have reviewed, Mr. Skilling was supposed to be an integral part of the controls and the review process with the LJM transactions. REP. TAUZIN: Now, did you his -- did you see Mr. Skilling\'s testimony last week before this committee? MS. WATKINS: Yes sir, I did. REP. TAUZIN: Did you specifically hear his testimony regarding the LJM approval sheets? MS. WATKINS: Yes, I did. REP. TAUZIN: Now, he basically testified that he never saw these sheets and he was not required to sign them, that\'s why he didn\'t sign them. Is it your testimony that he in fact knew about these sheets? MS. WATKINS: Well, all I can say is -- all I can speak to is that it was Enron\'s very strict policy, when completing transactions and deals, to have deal sheets, deal approval sheets, and there was never a name put on the approval block that was not required. And I don\'t ever remember an instance where signatures were not obtained for every person listed. REP. TAUZIN: So that if Mr. Skilling\'s name consistently appears on the sheets but it remains unsigned, it was not because he was not obligated to sign it, it was because he just didn\'t sign it. MS. WATKINS: That\'s correct. REP. TAUZIN: Is that correct? MS. WATKINS: That\'s -- that would be my understanding of our very strict procedures, yes. REP. TAUZIN: Were those procedures that Mr. Skilling would have understood? MS. WATKINS: Yes. REP. TAUZIN: You say that, also in the memo, that Mr. Lay, should admit that he trusted the wrong people. Are you saying that Mr. Lay was wrong to trust Mr. Skilling and Mr. Fastow and Mr. Causey with these details? MS. WATKINS: yes sir, I do believe they mis-served Mr. Lay, the board, Enron and its shareholders. REP. TAUZIN: In fact, you go on to say that Ken Lay his board were duped by a COO who wanted the targets met no matter what the consequences, a CFO motivated by personal greed, and two of the most respected firms, Arthur Andersen and company and Vinson & Elkins, who had both grown too wealthy off Enron\'s yearly business and no longer performed their roles as Ken Lay, the board, and just about everybody on the street would expect as a minimum standard for CPAs and attorneys. Do you believe that statement to be true? MS. WATKINS: Yes sir, I do. REP. TAUZIN: You say further on, ""the culprits are Skilling, Fastow, Glisson, Causey, as well as Arthur Andersen and Vinson & Elkins."" Do you believe that statement to be true? MS. WATKINS: Yes sir, I do. REP. TAUZIN: Now, in Mr. Skilling\'s testimony, he very specifically denied any knowledge that in these transactions Enron Corporation had not properly transferred the risk to cover the losses. Do you believe that statement to be true? MS. WATKINS: No, I do not. Mr. Skilling was a great proponent of looking to the markets to make sense of a transaction. And I doubt we could have hedged these volatile stocks with any true unrelated third party at the prices that we were actually able to obtain from Raptor. REP. TAUZIN: Is it your testimony, then, that Mr. Skilling must have known about the details of the Raptor transaction to know that risk had not transferred? MS. WATKINS: It is my opinion that he was probably aware that we could not have transacted at those prices with an unrelated third party, and the only reason Mr. Fastow was transacting with Enron through the Raptor transaction at those prices for volatile stocks was that Mr. Fastow could not lose money and he was backstopped by Enron stock. REP. TAUZIN: Ms. Watkins, you made it as clear as I\'ve ever seen anybody make it. You basically outlined for Mr. Lay what would happen if he did the right thing -- cleaned up this mess, reported correctly to his stockholders and investors, if he got rid of the culprits and if he made these public statements on behalf of the corporation, that he, in fact, was going to do everything to save his company; and that if he didn\'t take that advice, you told him, the worst is going to happen, it\'s going to happen anyhow, and Mr. Lay will be more implicated in this than is deserved. What did you mean by that? MS. WATKINS: Mr. Lay was back at the helm as CEO. And it is my humble opinion that he did not understand the gravity of the situation the company was in. REP. TAUZIN: Now, you explained to him, as the chairman has outlined, in rather detailed form, what you thought was wrong with Raptors, what you thought was wrong with these transactions. Did he understand the gravity, the implications of what you were telling him, in your opinion? MS. WATKINS: In my opinion, I don\'t think he did. And I have that opinion because at an October 23rd all-employee meeting to discuss the (write-downs?) that had occurred in the third quarter, there were several questions about Raptor and about the LJM transactions. And Mr. Lay likened the problem the company was now facing to a 1980s problem, when the Peruvian government nationalized an oil company Enron had, to the (J-Block?) problem Enron had in 1997. And I don\'t think an accounting manipulation problem is in any way related to a -- REP. TAUZIN: You\'re saying he didn\'t get it. MS. WATKINS: No. REP. TAUZIN: He didn\'t get it. Now, as I understand your memo to him, you\'re basically telling him that these officials of his corporation were engaging in these essentially improper activities, were doing it in a way that he and his board were being duped, kept in the dark. Who had the power to protect those people from discovery from Mr. Lay and his board? Who had the power to allow these activities to go forward by all of these employees, including investing themselves in some of these outside partnerships and entities at great profit? Who had the power to let all that happen and keep that information from the board and Mr. Lay all that while? MS. WATKINS: My opinion would be that would be Mr. Skilling. REP. TAUZIN: And finally, Ms. Watkins, I refer you to the document entitled ""Lessons Learned,"" tab eight. In that document, there are three points: Recognizing, in effect, the accounting hedge versus an economic hedge; the operation should consider hedging assets in Raptor to minimize credit capability volatility. The new Raptor structure transferred risk in the form of stock dilution. Did you show this document to Mr. Lay? MS. WATKINS: Yes, I did. REP. TAUZIN: Now, it changes handwriting. Whose handwriting is that? MS. WATKINS: That\'s my handwriting. REP. TAUZIN: The handwriting basically says, to the final point, ""There it is. That is the smoking gun. You cannot do this."" What did this mean? MS. WATKINS: Well, my concern was that this was a document Enron had produced. It was well-known. And what that bullet point is trying to say in plain English is that the new Raptor structure transferred income statement equity investment risk in the form of stock dilution. And you can never use your stock to invest the income statement. REP. TAUZIN: You just can\'t do that legitimately, legally. MS. WATKINS: That\'s correct. REP. TAUZIN: Where\'d you get this document? MS. WATKINS: From the risk assessment and control group, run by Mr. Richard Buy. REP. TAUZIN: And, if I may, what was Mr. Lay\'s reaction to this document when you showed it to him? MS. WATKINS: He was concerned. He was concerned with everything I was telling him. REP. TAUZIN: There\'s another note you wrote on the second point. ""The corporation isn\'t Raptor. How could corporation consider anything at Raptor?"" What\'d you mean by that? MS. WATKINS: Well, the bullet point just -- this is ""Corp should consider hedging assets in Raptor to minimize problems."" And if Raptor is supposed to be Mr. Fastow\'s company, then it\'s Mr. Fastow\'s problem. Why should Enron Corporation -- REP. TAUZIN: It\'s not the corporation. MS. WATKINS: -- consider anything (there?)? Exactly. REP. TAUZIN: Even with this, you still say he didn\'t get it. MS. WATKINS: I don\'t think so. REP. TAUZIN: Thank you, ma\'am. REP. GREENWOOD: The chair thanks the gentleman and recognizes the gentleman from Florida, Mr. Deutsch, for 10 minutes. REP. DEUTSCH: Thank you, Ms. Watkins. Someone reading through Enron\'s (statement?), would they have a perspective that those statements fairly represent the status of the company prior to the -- (inaudible)? MS. WATKINS: I don\'t think so. I think that related-party footnote is wholly inadequate in describing the transactions with Mr. Fastow\'s partnership. REP. DEUTSCH: Okay. So I think all of us would probably agree with what you just said. How was that able to happen? How were we able to get to the seventh-largest company in America, under what we consider general accounting principles, that those statements are supposed to fairly represent what\'s going on in the company, and you and me and, I think, anyone who\'s looked at this could come to the same conclusion that they do not? How did that happen? MS. WATKINS: It\'s inconceivable, and I don\'t understand how it happened. REP. DEUTSCH: And obviously it happened. I mean, at some point in time, someone had to have had discussions between people at Enron and their accountants, Arthur Andersen, and their attorneys, Vinson & Elkins. I mean, are you aware of discussions that would have allowed it to happen? MS. WATKINS: I can really just point to what Mr. Stupak said in ""The Emperor\'s New Clothes."" There were swindlers in ""The Emperor\'s New Clothes"" discussing the fine material that they were weaving. And I think Mr. Skilling and Mr. Fastow are highly intimidating, very smart individuals, and I think they intimidated a number of people into accepting some structures that were not truly acceptable. REP. DEUTSCH: This is somewhat of a sidelight, but I think something significant. At the time that you were obviously aware of what was going on -- I mean, that the statements of the company did not reflect, in fact, huge losses, in the billions of dollars, so what the value of Enron was, as reflected in its stock price, was not its true value, and there were people obviously in Enron that knew about this. And apparently what we know -- and I\'m trying to get a copy at this point, but it\'s a public domain at this point -- that effectively dozens of management people were selling hundreds of millions of dollars worth of stock at this period of time. So obviously people knew what was going on because my recollection is that there was only one actual purchase with dozens of sales. Was that the sort of culture of what was going on in terms of the inside management at this point in time, understanding, in fact, what you uncovered and what we know now, that the value was not -- that the liability of these Raptors was not reflected in the statement? MS. WATKINS: It\'s hard for me to say about executives who sold stock, because so many of them thought that somehow or other this was legitimate. I\'m -- REP. DEUTSCH: Legitimate, but they also knew that there was an actual loss out there; and legitimate also that it seems as if everyone understood that the partnership could never make good on that loss. So there was -- so people actually understood the partnership, understood that eventually that loss was going to come back to Enron. I mean, it might have been legal, but as a practical matter, in terms of the value of the company, I can\'t imagine how they wouldn\'t know that there was going to be a day of reckoning at some point in time. MS. WATKINS: You could be right. I can\'t really speculate. But there was a feeling -- I mean, Enron is a very arrogant place with a feeling of invincibility. And I\'m not certain people felt like it was that imminent. They just felt like Mr. Fastow, along with the accountants, would come up with some magic in the future. REP. DEUTSCH: Was there any thought at all -- because, again, I guess what I\'m hearing you say and what I\'ve looked at at this point is that anyone -- and I don\'t think you have to be a Harvard MBA at this point or an Arthur Andersen partner to understand that there were liabilities were not requested in the balance sheet of (the company?), huge liabilities, in the billions of dollars. And if you knew that and the market and the transparency of the public markets, you knew the stock was going to go down at some point. Was there any concern at all for shareholders, for employees who had 100 percent of their life savings in 401(k)s, to retired people throughout the country who had investments in Enron stock, who really have been devastated by this collapse of Enron? And was there any thought, any discussion of what this would mean to actual shareholders? MS. WATKINS: I never heard any discussion. REP. DEUTSCH: Did you have any sense at all that there was any concern for shareholders at all? MS. WATKINS: I don\'t recall any discussions of concerns like that. REP. DEUTSCH: You have testified -- and, you know, you have used the word, I guess, ""improper."" I feel comfortable using the word ""illegal,"" because, you know, I guess sometimes I debate whether to go into -- you know, what level of detail in terms of these transactions. But I think we have to go into some detail really to understand them, and also just to have it on the record in this sense. The hedging, okay, of (Vichy?), all right, that would have been a normal business decision. What was the original investment of the (Vichy?)? Do you know the details? MS. WATKINS: I don\'t have exactly what was -- REP. DEUTSCH: Do you have a ballpark number? MS. WATKINS: I really don\'t. I think it was under $10 million. REP. DEUTSCH: Okay, and what was the price when the hedge was put into effect, the value? MS. WATKINS: I believe around $166 or $170 a share. REP. DEUTSCH: So the value was $166 million at that point or more? MS. WATKINS: Enron\'s value was probably in excess of $150 million by then. REP. DEUTSCH: Okay. So the idea was to hedge that increase. And what you have said and what you\'ve testified to is, first of all, could they have gone to a legitimate third party, an investment bank, to buy a derivative, to buy a put for the strike price? Was that available? MS. WATKINS: I believe we had some hold restrictions on the stock, but probably there were some transactions, derivative transactions, that were available to us from unrelated parties. REP. DEUTSCH: Okay. And, again, just to kind of walk through the specific transaction, so in a ballpark number, what would an unrelated third party ask for to sell that type of put to lock in that gain? Just a ballpark number. MS. WATKINS: Well, I don\'t think you could have locked it in at that $170 price. REP. DEUTSCH: Right. MS. WATKINS: There would have been a significant haircut to that price. REP. DEUTSCH: Right. Can you use real numbers? MS. WATKINS: As much as -- REP. DEUTSCH: I\'m sorry. What? MS. WATKINS: As much as -- as much as, I would say, 30 or 40 percent. REP. DEUTSCH: Okay. And that strike price would be what number? MS. WATKINS: Probably more like $120 or $110; maybe even lower. I\'m -- REP. DEUTSCH: Okay. And then what was the price that was sold by the partnership, by the Raptor? MS. WATKINS: I don\'t believe that we have sold it. I believe the (Vichy?) is selling for -- REP. DEUTSCH: No, no, the put. MS. WATKINS: I think $170 a share. REP. DEUTSCH: No, no, but what was the -- what did it cost Enron to buy it from this partnership? MS. WATKINS: I\'m not familiar exactly with those details. REP. DEUTSCH: A ballpark, about -- MS. WATKINS: Well, I don\'t know exactly how the Raptor puts or fees were paid. I do know that approximately 35 million went to Mr. Fastow or went to LJM out of the Raptors, and that that was supposedly representing fees. But that was for all of the -- REP. DEUTSCH: Right, and I guess -- this is where, you know, I think we have crossed the line of a legal activity. Because what I hear you saying is that that transaction which you have just described, which was one of many transactions -- and basically there was this sort of cookie cutter of locking this in. And what appears to have happened is Arthur Andersen and Vinson and Elkins basically gave approval for this cookie cutter in terms of basically locking in value -- you lock in the gain on the balance sheet as a gain. Then you basically have this sham transaction. And that\'s the whole point. What you seem to be absolutely I think convinced of, and what I am as well, is that if a third party would have sold it at a market price and this sort of partnership which was headed by the CFO of the company, Mr. Fastow, as head of the general partnership as the general partner, basically selling it to yourself, and it\'s at a different price than a third-party price. By definition, you know, it\'s not an arm\'s length transaction. I mean, by definition, if the price is so significantly different. That\'s number one. And, number two, what is absolutely clear -- and I think just trying to elaborate on this a little bit, getting into some of the details, that there really -- the transaction never really existed, because as opposed to guaranteeing the gain, the general partnership -- no one in this transaction ever -- I mean, ever contemplated that the general partnership could ever guarantee the gain. I mean, they could only guarantee the gain if the stock went up and Enron\'s stock went up. Is that accurate? MS. WATKINS: Yes, it is. The saying around Enron was that heads, Mr. Fastow wins; tails, Enron loses. REP. DEUTSCH: And that obviously is not a transaction? MS. WATKINS: No. REP. DEUTSCH: That\'s not a business transaction. I mean, that\'s not a transaction that -- I mean, could you contemplate in any shape, manner or form that there was a business purpose? MS. WATKINS: No, other than -- other than making sure those losses were not borne by Enron\'s financial statements, which is not economic. REP. GREENWOOD: The time of the gentleman has expired. REP. DEUTSCH: Thank you. REP. GREENWOOD: The chair would note the presence of the gentleman from Oklahoma, Mr. Largent, and would also note that this is his last day as a member of the United States House of Representatives. He has long been a valued, respected, and I would say admired, member of this committee. We value his contribution. I understand that the gentleman does not have time to inquire -- or he does? REP. STEVE LARGENT (R-OK): Mr. Chairman, all I wanted to do was ask unanimous consent to submit my opening statement for the record. REP. GREENWOOD: Without objection, the gentleman\'s opening statement will be part of the record, and the chair and the committee wishes him well in his future endeavors, and recognizes the gentleman from North Carolina, Mr. Burr, for 10 minutes to inquire. REP. BURR: I thank the chair. We will miss Steve Largent. Sherron, once you started to look for the problems, how long did it take you to identify the degree of problems that existed in some of these transactions? MS. WATKINS: Actually not very long. I mean, I did know from the footnote that Enron had recognized $500 million of revenue in 2000 from the Raptor hedging transaction. Five hundred million is a significant number when you look at our net income for 2000. As soon as I discovered that the losses at Raptor were backstopped by Enron, and that\'s the way the structure worked, I knew we had a very large problem. REP. BURR: Could anybody charged with a review of what took place in these partnerships have missed it? MS. WATKINS: I don\'t think so. And I was highly alarmed that this had occurred, and allowed to go on for so long. REP. BURR: Did you feel like the letter that you had sent to Mr. Lay really did lay out a blueprint of what people should look at if they were outside concerns looking in at these transactions? MS. WATKINS: Yes, I did. REP. BURR: Let me go to the Vinson and Elkins -- I think this was a preliminary outline that they used that Mr. Dingell just put in the record. It was used to discuss -- to be a discussion graph with Mr. and Mr. Derrick. And specifically I want to go to item D, caveats, first one. And in that it says, ""No second guessing of accounting treatment by AA."" Interpret that for me, if you will. MS. WATKINS: That they did not want Vinson and Elkins to make any or give any opinions regarding whether the accounting treatment was proper -- just assume that it was. REP. BURR: Let me move to your meeting with Mr. Lay I think on August 22nd. You said you spent almost an hour. He seemed surprised by a lot of the things. But he made some commitments to you he\'d look into it, didn\'t he? MS. WATKINS: Yes, he did., REP. BURR: Having left that meeting, was there ever an exception that Mr. Lay made relative to these accounting discrepancies that you raised, that he wasn\'t going to look at those, but he might look at something else? MS. WATKINS: No, I understood that he was going to try to get to the bottom of my concerns. REP. BURR: Is there any way that what you shared with him could have been heard in a way that you could do an independent review of these transactions, leaving out second-guessing accounting treatment, and believe that you could fully understand what you had raised with him? MS. WATKINS: No. The point is the accounting treatment. The point is the accounting disclosures in the footnotes to the financial statements. REP. BURR: When you left that meeting with Ken Lay, did it ever cross your mind that they would turn to somebody who already had a relationship with Enron, be it Vinson and Elkins or Andersen, to actually do the review of their own work? MS. WATKINS: I didn\'t think they would choose V&E. I was slightly -- well, more than slightly disappointed to find out that they subsequently did choose Vinson and Elkins to conduct the investigation. REP. BURR: Did Mr. Lay stress with you that he would have a review done that was independent or that was thorough? MS. WATKINS: He stressed that he would get to the bottom of it. He would look into my concerns. He didn\'t really go into detail as to what he was going to do to do that. REP. BURR: I think that this discussion outlined for the meeting really lays out that no second guessing accounting treatment by Arthur Andersen, no detailed transaction analysis. And it seems that V&E was given very specific instructions: We need you to produce a report. We need you to stamp it okay -- but don\'t raise any questions about any of these things that have been brought to our attention. Is that pretty much what he did? MS. WATKINS: Well, it appears from this V&E document that they had a very limited scope. REP. BURR: Sherron, prior to the release of V&E\'s final report, they briefed your orally, I think on 10/16. Is that correct? MS. WATKINS: They -- I think they had issued their report. I had not seen it. I didn\'t see it until this year. They briefed me after the earnings release that morning. REP. BURR: And was that the first time that you knew that Vinson and Elkins had turned to Arthur Andersen to play a part in their review of the accounting discrepancies that you had raised that they had already signed off on? MS. WATKINS: Yes. That was -- it was roughly a two-hour meeting where Joe Dilg and Max Hendrick (ph) went through how they had conducted their investigation. The reason they said that they chose to have Arthur Andersen relook at their own work was in the interest of time -- that the company wanted a speedy response, and no other accounting firm could get up to speed on these transactions very quickly. But they also told me other things that -- where they had limited their investigation, despite suggestions that I had given them on September 10th, when we had initially met for three hours at the beginning of the investigation. REP. BURR: What was your reaction to that? MS. WATKINS: I was highly alarmed. I did not think it was good advice for Mr. Lay. They told me that the conclusion was the accounting was appropriate when done. The cosmetics were bad, but it was appropriate. And I felt like that was -- especially since I knew that we had unwound these transactions and written off a billion two in shareholder equity that very morning. We happened to close that day at $33 a share, the same -- about the same price we had opened with that morning. But my concern was that that wasn\'t going to stick, that I gave it less than a 5 percent probability that this was going to go quietly. And I was highly concerned that not only had the Titanic hit the iceberg, but we were already tilting. REP. BURR: Is it safe to say you didn\'t feel like the commitment that Mr. Lay had made to you to get to the bottom of it had successfully been accomplished? MS. WATKINS: Yes, that\'s correct. I did not feel that. REP. BURR: Sherron, one last question, if I can -- and it really deals with Enron management and their interaction between themselves and their audit firm. Are you aware at any point in that relationship as these partnerships were created, or as they fell, where Enron management in any way, shape or form used anything persuasive to encourage Andersen to turn their head or shut their eyes at the structure or the outcome of these partnerships? MS. WATKINS: I don\'t think it was a turn-the-head kind of deal. Mr. Rogers, when I met with him August 17th, he did say, Well, we push our internal accountants quite hard. He mentioned we probably push our outside auditors pretty hard. So he seemed to indicate that there was probably a lot of pressure that Enron put on Andersen to accept the structures that Enron was developing around the Raptor vehicles. REP. BURR: And given the timing of the V&E briefing with you, which was 10/16, which was close to that financial reporting period, can you share with me what V&E said about the 10/16 earnings release? MS. WATKINS: About the earnings release itself? REP. BURR: About that current earnings release -- what they said on 10/16. Did they address the earnings release? MS. WATKINS: Well -- REP. BURR: I think it was a press statement that went out -- I think that was the announcement of the $577 million -- MS. WATKINS: It was -- we had a press release that we had unwound some of the LJM transactions, and taken these write-offs and reductions of shareholder equity in the third quarter. It was my opinion we should restate. And Mr. Dilg responded, Do you really think Mr. Lay should ignore the advice of his counsel in this matter? REP. BURR: Given that you are going through a release from Enron for the $577 million adjustment, and a write-down of $1.2 billion in shareholder equity, how is that consistent with the report that V&E is briefing you on that there\'s no problem s? MS. WATKINS: Well, it was -- it was very surprising to me. I said, Well, if you told Mr. Lay that the accounting was appropriate, why did we unwind these deals? Why take a billion two write-down to equity if these deals were okay? And they said -- their reply to me was that, Well, that was a business decision I believe Mr. Lay felt like that these transactions were a distraction from core business, and he just decided to unwind them. REP. BURR: Sherron, thank you very much. I yield back. REP. GREENWOOD: The chair thanks the gentleman and recognizes the gentleman from Michigan, Mr. Stupak, for 10 minutes. REP. STUPAK: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Ms. Watkins, thanks again for coming. Let me pick up a little bit where Mr. Burr just left off. In this financial statement, there was pressure there to approve these special SPEs and these transactions, and you said a question about Enron putting pressure -- they said, Well, I am sure there\'s pressure on the internal auditors and external auditors. But before a financial statement goes public, doesn\'t Arthur Andersen have at least a fiduciary responsibility to say this ain\'t right, it\'s not going in the financial statement, before it\'s put out to the public? MS. WATKINS: Well, my understanding as a former accountant is that, you know, it\'s an odd situation. The accounting industry is paid by public -- by companies requesting their services. But your -- an accounting firm is supposed to keep their eye on who is relying on their opinions. Outside investors are relying on their opinions. That\'s who they are there to protect. And they make an opinion that these financial statements, including the footnotes, fairly represent the financial condition of the company. REP. STUPAK: If these transactions are questionable, that may not fairly accurately represent the financial position of a company, and they really have the ultimate responsibility before it\'s released to the public to say yes or no to putting these out. Is that a fair statements? MS. WATKINS: Yes, that\'s correct. REP. STUPAK: How about Vinson and Elkins -- would they have the same kind of responsibility on the financial statements? MS. WATKINS: I don\'t -- I don\'t think law firms necessarily have the same responsibility. REP. STUPAK: Let me take you back a few years. Eight years ago -- you said for eight years you worked for Arthur Andersen. MS. WATKINS: Yes. REP. STUPAK: While you\'re at Arthur Andersen did you have any document retention policy back then? MS. WATKINS: I am sure we did. REP. STUPAK: Okay. Then let me ask the question this way: While at Arthur Andersen, how often did you see a memo or correspondence from the higher-ups saying, Just want to remind you all of our retention policy, i.e. destruction policy? MS. WATKINS: I don\'t recall a lot of information about that. That was of course 14 or so years ago, and I am sure the policies have changed. REP. STUPAK: But during your eight years, did you ever remember receiving or seeing one of these memos saying, Just want to remind you of our retention policy? MS. WATKINS: I don\'t recall necessarily any specific memo on that. REP. STUPAK: Okay. In your eight years at Arthur Andersen, for a while you were based in Houston. Did you work on the Enron account then? MS. WATKINS: No, I did not work on the Enron account. REP. STUPAK: Okay. You took Cliff Baxter\'s position as vice president under Mr. Fastow, correct? MS. WATKINS: Well, no. When Mr. Baxter resigned, the whole corporate development function was assigned and put under Mr. Fastow. So I went to work directly for Mr. Fastow with -- helping him in that corporate development area. REP. STUPAK: Did you work under Mr. Baxter before then? MS. WATKINS: Indirectly, yes, I did. REP. STUPAK: Do you have any reason, or do you know why he retired? MS. WATKINS: It was to spend more time with his family. REP. STUPAK: Wasn\'t forced out of the company or anything like that? MS. WATKINS: No. REP. STUPAK: Okay. Is it fair to say that these questionable transactions, the LJM and Raptor -- would they possibly be discovered by the next vice president who went in there? MS. WATKINS: I think they were easy to discover. The facts weren\'t really hidden. REP. STUPAK: Okay. In response to a question from Mr. Dingell, if I heard you correctly, you said Cliff Baxter complained to Mr. Skilling. What did he complain to Mr. Skilling about? MS. WATKINS: My understanding is that Mr. Baxter complained that it was inappropriate for a company of our size, of our stature, to do transactions with the CFO\'s partnership. It was inappropriate, it didn\'t look good -- we should be doing transactions with the CFO\'s partnership. REP. STUPAK: And the CFO at this time was Mr. Fastow? MS. WATKINS: Mr. Fastow. REP. STUPAK: In your opinion, why did Mr. Skilling then leave Enron on August 14th, 2001? MS. WATKINS: It\'s my opinion that he could foresee these problems and he wanted to get away as far away from it as possible. REP. STUPAK: Again some questions from Mr. Dingell -- he indicated when asked about Raptor and LJM the hedging, it was common knowledge how they were doing this, and that it really wouldn\'t stand up, because their assets weren\'t there. Common knowledge by who? MS. WATKINS: The different business units that were hedging their assets with Raptor, as well as the global finance staff under Mr. Fastow. REP. STUPAK: Mr. Dingell actually read a little bit from this one document which he placed on the record -- I believe it\'s on page 8. And it said, ""Notwithstanding these bad cosmetics, Enron representatives uniformly stated that the Condor and Raptor vehicles were clever, useful vehicles that benefited Enron."" So my question -- if they\'re pledged 100 percent with Enron stock, and then they couldn\'t meet the hedges as the stock started to fall, therefore they didn\'t benefit Enron, the employees or other shareholders of Enron, did they? MS. WATKINS: No, they did not. REP. STUPAK: I mean, clever, but not legal and not benefiting Enron? MS. WATKINS: Yes, that\'s correct. REP. STUPAK: Who did they benefit? MS. WATKINS: They -- you could possibly say that they benefited Enron, because it allowed Enron to meet projected financial targets, which kept Enron\'s stock price inflated. REP. STUPAK: Okay. So then that benefit then would go to Enron, but that benefit was then taken out of Enron, was it not? MS. WATKINS: Well, it\'s -- the problem I have with it is it keeps the stock price inflated. And you had Mr. Skilling saying, Our stock price was going to go to $120 per share. So you have people buying that inflated stock price, thinking the stock price is going to go higher. Those are now new shareholders of Enron that certainly are not benefited by these transactions. REP. STUPAK: Okay. Let me ask you this question then. And by no means do I mean anything negative by it. But we have had testimony throughout about how certain employees benefited handsomely financially from some of these transactions and being part of these SPEs. Were you ever offered an opportunity to join in one of these or to be part of one? MS. WATKINS: No, I was not. REP. STUPAK: So it\'s fair to say then you didn\'t invest in any of these SPEs, like some did, that put $5,800 in and they end up coming back with a million within two months or three months? MS. WATKINS: No, I did not. REP. STUPAK: Okay. You indicated -- let me to go this question. In number 8 here, it was in our book here, number 8 -- was the Raptor h edging strategy analysis risk and assessment control. And the chairman asked you some questions about it. In fact, on one page, Lessons learned -- the new Raptor structure transferred risk in the form of stock dilution. And in your handwriting, there it is, that\'s the smoking gun -- ""You cannot do this"" -- and that\'s your handwriting? MS. WATKINS: Yes, it is. REP. STUPAK: Who produced this document? MS. WATKINS: Mr. Rick Buy\'s risk assessment and control group. REP. STUPAK: Do you know when he would have produced it? MS. WATKINS: I believe that this was produced during the first quarter of 2001 to address the fact that the Raptor structures were under water. REP. STUPAK: So risk assessment under Mr. Buy produced this in the first quarter of 2001. Who was this distributed to? MS. WATKINS: I am not completely certain of that. I believe it might have gone as high as the finance committee of the board. But from reading the Powers Report, they do not have appeared to have seen this analysis. REP. STUPAK: So, okay -- and this was an internal document? MS. WATKINS: It probably went certainly to Mr. Fastow -- and I would imagine that it also went to Mr. Skilling. REP. STUPAK: How about Vinson and Elkins? Would they probably receive this? MS. WATKINS: Probably not. REP. STUPAK: Arthur Andersen? MS. WATKINS: Probably not. REP. STUPAK: Okay. But you thought probably the board of directors may have received this? MS. WATKINS: I thought so at the time when I was meeting with Mr. Lay. But from reading the Powers Report it appears that they did not see this. REP. STUPAK: So when you put in here your comments, or even the new Raptor structure transferred risk in the form of stock dilution, not knowing anything about this before this whole Enron thing, even I can pick it up now. Anyone who received this in the company should have realized there were serious, serious problem. And any accountant worth their weight in salt would certainly pick this up, would they not? MS. WATKINS: Well, I mean, it would certainly seem so. But it was so well understood and so prevalent -- that is why I called Mr. Hecker at Andersen. I was about to meet with Mr. Lay, and I thought -- well, I called him, but since I had not been in accounting for over 10 years to say, you know, Could this ever be okay? And he said it didn\'t sound right. And his words to me were, Sherron, any accounting treatment must be clearly defensible if fully exposed. So if this is not clearly defensible when fully exposed, you are probably correct, and you should go see Mr. Lay. REP. GREENWOOD: The time of the gentleman has expired. The chair thanks the gentleman. The chair recognizes the gentleman from Florida, Mr. Stearns, for 10 minutes to inquire. REP. STEARNS: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And, Sherron, let me thank you and also the staff for the prodigious amount of work they have here. Just to get on the record that it is more applicable to the committee that I chair dealing with FASB, I just wanted to ask you some questions. There is ample evidence, as I noted, that Enron at a minimum used -- abused financial accounting standards to confuse its true financial condition. In your view, is Enron indicative of a failure to implement GAAP, generally accepted accounting principles, or a failure of the generally accepted accounting principles -- in other words, failure of the GAAP itself, or a failure to implement these principles? MS. WATKINS: I think Enron had a failure to implement them correctly. REP. STEARNS: So you don\'t think there\'s anything generally wrong with the GAAP itself? Do you think GAAP works? MS. WATKINS: It should work. In my opinion, I think somehow in this country our financial accounting system has morphed into the tax code. And, you know, in the tax accounting, if you follow the codes, whatever result you get, you are justified in using that treatment. In financial accounting, a number of my accounting friends have said if you follow the rules, even if you get squirrely results, you know, you have a leg to stand on. And I am surprised that the financial accounting system has morphed into that, because you should still fairly represent your financial condition. REP. STEARNS: This is to me a very important point. You know, what you are saying is that Enron\'s problem was a flawed corporate strategy, and simple, old-fashioned bad assets, and that the accounting problems did not precipitate it\'s collapse -- is that what you\'re saying? MS. WATKINS: No, I do think the accounting problems precipitated the collapse, because when the investing community was uncertain about our numbers, when they were driving the stock price down, almost everyone was aware that if the stock price dropped too low, if our investment grade rating fell away, there would be additional debt coming due. And we did have an old-fashioned run on the bank. The -- REP. STEARNS: So -- but you are saying that the GAAP worked, and it was -- GAAP was not the problem. The accountants -- it was more the business strategy and how they used the accounting principles, how they implemented it? MS. WATKINS: They did not implement them correctly. REP. STEARNS: Okay. So if you went to the American Institute of Accountants and talked to them, you wouldn\'t recommend that they change anything with Raptor partnerships or LJM 1 or 2, or anything -- you\'d say that\'s not the problem? MS. WATKINS: Well, I don\'t think Enron reported the accounting -- the accounting of these transactions I think was inappropriate. We should not have been able to -- REP. STEARNS: But that was because of the people. That was Mr. Fastow and his people. MS. WATKINS: Yes. REP. STEARNS: But it wasn\'t Arthur Andersen? MS. WATKINS: Well, Andersen also signed off on the way we were implementing these accounting -- REP. STEARNS: But if Arthur Andersen was told something and it was not the truth, they might accept it. Is it possible that Arthur Andersen has some culpability here because they signed off on it? MS. WATKINS: I think so, because they are charged with auditing the results, and a sensitive related-party transaction should get a lot of scrutiny. REP. STEARNS: So, Arthur Andersen, in your opinion, signed off on something they shouldn\'t have. MS. WATKINS: yes. REP. STEARNS: Do you think they knew what they were signing off on? MS. WATKINS: They sure should have known what they were signing off on. REP. STEARNS: Okay. Okay. So, you know, you\'ve been an accountant, it said -- you told me in your opening statement, for 19 years, and yet you\'re the only one here out of this huge organization we have here. And, you know, we have talked to Jeffrey McMahon -- McMahon, who is president and chief operating officer. He said he went to Skilling. We talked to Jordan Mintz, who is vice president and general counsel of corporate development. He tried to get Skilling to sign documents. Both Richard Buy, the chief risk officer, and Richard Causey, the chief accounting officer, all somehow were aware of this, and yet you\'re the only one standing here. And so, when you went to Mr. Lay and he came back and said he was going to -- V&E was going to do an analysis -- I think it was on October 31st -- did he say anything to you about maybe firing Vinson & Elkins? MS. WATKINS: I met with Mr. Lay on October 30th and the 31st, and, you know, I was concerned that we -- we needed to restate, come clean, and -- REP. STEARNS: Because this is a key point -- you were -- the report came back and everybody was ready to act on it, and we\'ll clean house and get this thing straightened out, right? Isn\'t that your impression? MS. WATKINS: Well, he had said at the time, ""Well, we have fired Vinson & Elkins and Arthur,"" which I was a little bit surprised. When I met with him the following day, he corrected that and said, ""No, that we had formed this special committee and hired a new law firm and a new accounting firm to look into my concerns."" REP. STEARNS: What was the new law firm named that he said he was going to hire after he replaced Vinson & Elkins? MS. WATKINS: He -- he first said it was Milner (sp) and something, which sort of surprised me because when the announcement came out, it Wilmer, Cutler, and that\'s an easy name to remember. And I - it gave me the impression that Mr. Lay was not making these decisions, that someone else was, and they were just informing him of the decisions. REP. STEARNS: So, he told you earlier, though, that he was going to fire Arthur Andersen and V&E, right? MS. WATKINS: Yes. And I think he misunderstood, though, the -- (inaudible) -- REP. STEARNS: And who was telling him that, do you think? MS. WATKINS: I don\'t know. I\'m not privy to the inner-workings. REP. STEARNS: I talked to Mr. Skilling, and I talked to him briefly about Cliff Baxter, and I just wanted to ask you a question on this. In your memo you said he complained mightily to Mr. Skilling and all who would listen about the inappropriateness of the transaction with LJM. Did Mr. Baxter discuss his concerns about these transactions with you? MS. WATKINS: I -- actually, the last time I spoke with Mr. Baxter was January 15th of this year. I phoned him to give him the heads-up that my memo had been discovered and was in the press, and that it mentioned that executives had warned Mr. Skilling. So I told Mr. Baxter that I had mentioned him specifically and I read to him over the phone exactly what I had written about it. And he said, ""Sherron, you\'re right. You know, I was very concerned about these transaction."" He said, ""But I\'ll tell you what, if I had known there was anything illegal about it, I would have pushed it further."" REP. STEARNS: Did Mr. Baxter tell you that he talked to Skilling frequently about this? I mean, you say ""mightily."" Did he actually say, ""I talked to him 10 times, three times, one time""? MS. WATKINS: When he -- he told me he spoke to him quite often about the inappropriateness of a company of our stature -- REP. STEARNS: Okay. Did Mr. Baxter ever tell Ken Lay -- did Baxter ever say to you, ""I also mentioned it to Kenneth Lay because I was frustrated with Mr. Skilling""? MS. WATKINS: No. The way the culture worked, I don\'t think anyone would have gone around Mr. Skilling to talk to Mr. Lay. REP. STEARNS: Okay. Okay. What about Jeff McMahon. What -- did you actually ever talk to him about any of these problems? MS. WATKINS: I did meet with -- REP. STEARNS: Were you aware of -- that Mr. McMahon, he was -- he met with Skilling. He obviously -- he was the president and chief operating officer, a former treasurer of the company. He recently became president. He said he told Mr. Skilling of his concern over the company\'s many complex partnerships. Did you ever talk to him? MS. WATKINS: On August 21st, I met with Mr. McMahon for roughly an hour-and-a-half. I mean, that is when he told me that he found the conflicts to be -- to be something that -- you know, too great for Enron. REP. STEARNS: Too great for Enron? MS. WATKINS: Mr. McMahon did not characterize it as a bonus discussion with me. He characterized it as more of an ultimatum that he was giving Mr. Skilling -- you know, make these changes or I can\'t stay as treasurer. And I -- and as I recall the -- Mr. McMahon telling me, he felt like that was a strong statement to Mr. Skilling. And, you know, a few days or weeks later he gets a call saying -- from Mr. Skilling -- that Mr. Skilling wanted him to go join a new venture, Enron Networks. And Mr. McMahon told me that he felt like Mr. Skilling was setting him up for a fall. REP. STEARNS: I asked Mr. Skilling about Mr. McMahon and this conversation. He said, ""We talked nothing about what you mentioned, Congressman. All we talked about was compensation."" I don\'t know if you heard Mr. Skilling say that. MS. WATKINS: It sounds like that\'s -- REP. STEARNS: So, Mr. McMahon -- MS. WATKINS: -- the truth, but not the whole truth. REP. STEARNS: Right. So, Mr. Skilling is trying to convince me they\'re talking about the bonus for Mr. McMahon, and that\'s all they talked about, yet it was clear to me and all the information we had, that Mr. McMahon was telling him about the stuff that you just know about. And that\'s -- and that\'s what you\'re saying, that when you talked to Mr. McMahon, that he told you the same thing, that he talked to him all about these partnerships. MS. WATKINS: He -- the Raptor transactions had not been done, I don\'t think, or -- I\'m not completely aware. Mr. McMahon told me he did not talk about accounting issues as much as they were -- these deals were likely not benefitting Enron shareholders, they were likely benefitting Mr. Fastow and not Enron shareholders. REP. STEARNS: Okay. So that is directly opposite to what Mr. Skilling told us. And you\'re telling us that Mr. McMahon told you that, and Mr. McMahon has also told us that\'s what he told him. So, I think it\'s clear at this point that there\'s two witnesses here that do not agree with what Mr. Skilling has said. I think my time is up, Mr. Chairman. Unless Ms. Watkins would like to clarify -- REP. GREENWOOD: Did you want -- did Ms. Watkins, did you want to clarify anything? MS. WATKINS: Well, I just wanted to add that I had also heard from one of Mr. Baxter\'s close friends that he had a conversation with Mr. Skilling in March of 2001. Mr. Baxter\'s recollection of the meeting was that he told Mr. Skilling ""we are headed for a train wreck, and it is your job to get out in front of the train and try to stop it."" REP. STEARNS: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. REP. GREENWOOD: The chair recognizes the gentle lady from Colorado, Ms. DeGette, for 10 minutes. And we would note that at the end of her questioning, we will recess for approximately 20 minutes for the vote. REP. DIANA DEGETTE (D-CO): Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Ms. Watkins, before I ask my questions, I just want to welcome you and let you know how impressed I was by your memos and by your testimony. And when I was reading this, I felt sort of a bond with you. And first I thought, well, maybe it was because we were both women of about the same age working the male-dominated field. I thought, no, it\'s not that. Then I said maybe it\'s because we\'re both moms, because moms tend to get -- you know, you can figure out if someone\'s telling the truth. But then I realized no, it\'s not that. What it is is both of our mothers were teachers, as I understand. Your mother taught accounting. My mother taught kindergarten. And then I realized that both perfectly prepared us for the careers we were going to embark on. (Laughter.) And I really want to thank you for coming. I want to ask you, did you write these memos, Ms. Watkins, all by yourself? MS. WATKINS: Yes, I did. REP. DEGETTE: So, if someone said that you ghost -- that someone else, like Mr. McMahon, ghost-wrote these memos, that would not be true? MS. WATKINS: That is not true. REP. DEGETTE: And you wrote these because you were concerned about the future of the company and the future for the shareholders, didn\'t you? MS. WATKINS: Yes. REP. DEGETTE: Did you -- were you aware that Mr. Fastow told the Vinson & Elkins investigators that it was his belief that you were acting in conjunction with a person who wanted Mr. Fastow\'s job? MS. WATKINS: I think that\'s ludicrous. REP. DEGETTE: It\'s not true, is it. MS. WATKINS: No. REP. DEGETTE: Are you surprised Mr. Fastow might think that? MS. WATKINS: I\'m not surprised he would think that. REP. DEGETTE: Why not? MS. WATKINS: I understand that he and Mr. McMahon had a rather contentious relationship. REP. DEGETTE: And so you think he was referring to Mr. McMahon? MS. WATKINS: Yes. REP. DEGETTE: Now, you worked for Arthur Andersen for eight years, but it was a long time ago, right? MS. WATKINS: Yes. REP. DEGETTE: And, you\'re a CPA, right? MS. WATKINS: Yes, I am. REP. DEGETTE: Now, let me ask you this. How long had you been working for Mr. Fastow before you figured out that there were problems with the Raptor SPEs? MS. WATKINS: I\'d say about three or four weeks. REP. DEGETTE: So, all these people who said these were very complex transactions, and there wasn\'t much transparency, it didn\'t take an accounting genius -- although I am sure you are one -- but, I mean, you figured it out in three or four weeks, right? MS. WATKINS: Well, I had the advantage of hindsight, when these structures were clearly under water. And also, I was never shown the complex transactions. I just knew what the facts were. Raptor owed us $700,000 million. No-one had lost that money; Enron shareholders were going to pay for it in the future. So I didn\'t need to see the structure. I knew that that wasn\'t kosher. REP. DEGETTE: Even -- even Congress people like us can figure that out. So, now, you said that information -- in your testimony, you said the information gathered from coworkers helped you come to the conclusion that the Raptor SPEs were financially untenable. It was pretty common knowledge and discussion among the coworkers about these entities, correct? MS. WATKINS: Yes, it was. REP. DEGETTE: Can you tell me how widespread the concern was? MS. WATKINS: The Enron Global Finance Staff knew about it, and various business units that had sold assets to Raptor knew about it. There were whole sections of Enron -- the pipeline group, the trading group -- that had no idea about it. But in a handful of groups, it was widespread knowledge. REP. DEGETTE: Well, what about your group? I mean, did people talk about this commonly? How many people are we talking about? MS. WATKINS: I think a fair number. I mean, one of the things I asked Vinson & Elkins to do was to look at -- a survey had been conducted by Mr. Lay over the Labor Day weekend, and I knew of at least a dozen people who had typed in serious concerns about our accounting. REP. DEGETTE: You knew a dozen people who had typed in concerns? MS. WATKINS: Yes. REP. DEGETTE: Ms. Watkins, would you be willing to share those names with this committee? MS. WATKINS: I can -- I can share certainly at least two because they are in the documents that you are releasing today. REP. DEGETTE: Would you be willing to, in our -- as part of our investigation, to share the rest of them? MS. WATKINS: Well, I can share Jeff Donahue, who was managing director in charge of corporate development. REP. DEGETTE: Okay. MS. WATKINS: Kim Detling (sp), a managing director in corporate development. Michelle Nezzy (sp) Marvin one of the business unit people who hedged assets with Raptor. REP. DEGETTE: Jeff McMahon. MS. WATKINS: I don\'t know whether he typed in comments or not. REP. DEGETTE: Oh, he didn\'t type -- but he was concerned, right? MS. WATKINS: Yes. REP. DEGETTE: Cliff Baxter was concerned. MS. WATKINS: Yes. REP. DEGETTE: If you have other names, perhaps you could work with your counsel and with our staff, because that would help us in our investigation. I\'m wondering if you can try to characterize the atmosphere in the Global Finance Group and maybe elsewhere in Enron -- did everybody know what was going on, but everybody was too afraid to do anything about it? MS. WATKINS: It was rather widespread knowledge that Mr. Ray Bowman had -- was complaining about the Raptor structures and LJM. And Mr. Fastow called him in and gave him, as Mr. McMahon puts it, a high-decibel grilling. And so that, I think, made others -- it was like an off-limits subject. You just didn\'t even want to discuss it around the water cooler. REP. DEGETTE: So, it wasn\'t that everybody certainly at your level, knew but didn\'t care; it\'s that they were afraid to come forward. Would that be a fair characterization? MS. WATKINS: Yes. REP. DEGETTE: Now, why is it that you think Mr. Skilling knew about these issues? MS. WATKINS: Because he was an intense, hands-on manager. REP. DEGETTE: What does that -- can you give us a couple of examples of financial transactions you saw Mr. Skilling get involved in hands-on? MS. WATKINS: Well, for instance, in 1996, when I was still managing the JEDI partnership, we had equity investments in various -- primarily oil- and gas-related companies. That was the year we adopted fair-value accounting, which meant that, as an example, if we paid $100 million for an investment, an oil and gas company, and they drilled a dozen wells that were all successful, if our models showed us that we now thought that company was worth $150 million, we would write that company up by $50 million and recognize $50 million in the income statement. Well, a lot of the models were based off the multiples at which E&P companies trade. They were based off a comparable analysis in the marketplace. Mr. Skilling was very concerned that if the multiples, that might have been as high as seven or eight, cyclically moved down to, say, three or four, then our own models would force us to take a write-down. And he sat in on a number of meetings where I was present where we were trying to devise a real hedging strategy to avoid facing those losses on the income statement. REP. DEGETTE: So he was involved hands-on -- MS. WATKINS: Yes. REP. DEGETTE: -- personally in accounting meetings, talking about accounting treatments of transactions. You saw the transaction sheets that the chairman showed you, the four that had the signature line for his approval. Would it, in your experience, be like Mr. Skilling to not sign those? MS. WATKINS: No. The procedures around our approval sheets were cast in stone. REP. DEGETTE: And were they used in many transactions? MS. WATKINS: Yes. Any capital expended at Enron above a certain amount had a deal approval sheet, and the procedures were very well- identified. And I never recall an instance where the approvals, indicated via the approval signature block, were not obtained. REP. DEGETTE: So if someone sent those to Mr. Skilling and he didn\'t sign them, in your opinion, that would be intentionally? MS. WATKINS: No deal could be done without all those approvals. And quite often it was a verbal approval over the phone, and then it was always followed up by a signature. REP. DEGETTE: Thank you very much. Thank you for coming today. I really appreciate it. REP. GREENWOOD: With the gentlelady\'s remaining time, Mr. Skilling\'s testimony here last week was that while there was a line provided -- his term was there was a line provided for his signature; the form provided for his signature -- that he was advised that his signature was not required. Are you aware of any such distinction with regard to those deal sheets? MS. WATKINS: No, those deal sheets were cast in stone. If it was an either/or, it would say, you know, ""One of the following two signatures are required."" If the name was listed in the signature block, it was required. REP. GREENWOOD: It was required. And there was never any provided for as if he could sign it if he felt like it. MS. WATKINS: No, it was a requirement. REP. GREENWOOD: Do you know anything about Jordan Mintz\'s efforts to get him to sign that sheet? MS. WATKINS: I did not know of those until I heard his testimony here last week. REP. GREENWOOD: Okay. The chair thanks the gentlelady. The committee will recess for approximately 15 minutes. (Recess.) REP. GREENWOOD: The committee will come to order. The chair recognizes Mr. Strickland for ten minutes for purposes of inquiry. REP. STRICKLAND: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Ms. Watkins, toward the end of 1999, while you were working for Enron International, representing the Caribbean region, you negotiated the sale of Promigas, an Enron asset to a special, to a special purpose entity known as White Wing. Is that correct? MS. WATKINS: Yes, it\'s also known by its project name, which is Condor. REP. STRICKLAND: Ok. Enron\'s Caribbean region decided to sell Promigas to Whitewing because Enron\'s risk and finance departments had put out the word that all division should sell merchant assets to White Wing by the end of the 3rd and 4th quarters of \'99. Besides that mandate, was there any other reason for Enron to sell Promigas to Whitewing at that time? MS. WATKINS: No, there was not. REP. STRICKLAND: Ms. Watkins, would you please briefly explain what a merchant asset is for the benefit of this committee? MS. WATKINS: Enron has both merchant assets and strategic assets. Merchant assets are assets considered held for sale -- that we have bought for investment purposes, and that we generally do not intend to hold onto for any length of time. Merchant assets could be fair valued, meaning they could be written up to estimated market value; while strategic assets, if they were worth more than Enron had paid for them, those gains could not be recognized until we sold or disposed of the asset. REP. STRICKLAND: Okay. Now, Enron decided to sell its merchant assets to Whitewing in order to increase its cash flow. Was there any other reason for this decision? MS. WATKINS: I believe that the assets sold to Condor Whitewing, the merchant assets, generated -- I know they generated funds flow from operations for Enron, and I believe that to be one of the sole purposes for selling assets into Condor Whitewing. REP. STRICKLAND: Okay. In fact, cash flow had become a big concern for Enron -- had it not? MS. WATKINS: Yes, that\'s correct. REP. STRICKLAND: Now, Wall Street analysts began to distrust Enron\'s increasingly complex earnings statements, so they started examining the company\'s cash flow. After all, cash is cash. However, since Enron had been manipulating its earnings, its cash flow would appear inadequate compared to its inflated earnings statements. This was a problem for Enron, was it not? MS. WATKINS: Well, I am not certain that Enron was manipulating its earnings at that point in time, but for a commodity trader where you would routinely mark to market positions, you can have earnings that represent the discounted fair value of 10 years worth of profits. You recognize that in the first year, but you would only have cash flow of, say, one tenth of that profit in that year. That is probably not a unheard-of phenomenon with trading companies, but trading companies have PE multiples in the 12 to 14 range. Enron enjoyed a much larger price-to-earnings multiple, and did not want to be characterized as a normal trading company. The analysts were concerned that our funds flow from operations was significantly lower than our earnings. It was a financial performance statistic that they were concerned about, and Enron attempted to fix that first fairly legitimately by securitizing contracts and selling them out to outside third parties. I might want to correct a statement that Mr. Congressman Greenwood made earlier. I do think that the Cactus vehicles, the contract assets securitization vehicles that we did in the early \'90s and \'95, \'96, were legitimate -- were legitimate securitizations. Condor, however, I think was one of the first special purpose vehicles that was backstopped by Enron stock that was kept off balance sheet. And I think one of the main purposes of Condor Whitewing was to generate funds flow from operations for Enron. REP. STRICKLAND: So -- and correct me if I say something that you think is factually inaccurate, but it seems that Enron planned to increase its cash flow by selling these merchant assets to Whitewing during the third and fourth quarters of 1999? MS. WATKINS: That\'s correct, yes. REP. STRICKLAND: Did Enron provide any guarantees to Whitewing for these transactions that you know of? MS. WATKINS: The Whitewing structure was set up such that if the assets that were sold to Whitewing were not liquidated and were not sufficient to repay the investors in Whitewing, then that structure was backstopped by Enron\'s stock. REP. STRICKLAND: So this was a transaction where Enron guaranteed an investment with its own stock? Is that a factually correct statement? MS. WATKINS: These vehicles have been schematically depicted in the Wall Street Journal and in the Houston Chronicle, and a number of press. It supposedly is legitimate. I don\'t quite understand how these things can be off balance sheet when you are -- when you have a claw back to the company and to the company\'s own stock, but somehow or other they appear to be available for use. REP. STRICKLAND: And I am impressed with your background check and your training. And I sit here and I hear you say that, and I am wondering at what point is there some authority that has the ability to explain why something that appears to be illegitimate may be legitimate. Is that a puzzle to you as a professional CPA and a person who is deeply knowledgeable about financial transactions? MS. WATKINS: Well, the Condor structure troubled me, the fact that it was off-balance-sheet troubled me, the fact that we were getting funds flow from operations, a financial performance statistic, from this structure troubled me. And while I was working in the Caribbean business unit we were instructed that we now had new targets -- they were funds-flow targets, and we needed to find a way of selling our merchant assets into Condor Whitewing. It was almost like something that was on paper, not real, because the business unit continued to manage the asset, the counterparty never understood that we had supposedly sold it, and there was an unspoken understanding that we could buy it back at some point in the future. REP. STRICKLAND: Now, after Enron sold Promigas to Whitewing, who managed and operated that company? MS. WATKINS: The Caribbean business unit. It stayed with the Caribbean business unit. REP. STRICKLAND: And that was Enron? MS. WATKINS: Yes, that\'s Enron. But it was not Whitewing personnel that managed it; it was Enron personnel who managed it. REP. STRICKLAND : In fact, the people involved in the day-to- day functioning of Promigas didn\'t even know that they had been -- that it had been sold -- is that correct? MS. WATKINS: That\'s correct. REP. STRICKLAND: Ms. Watkins, who was the general partner of Whitewing? In other words, who ran Whitewing? MS. WATKINS: I believe it was something called an Osprey or something, but it was an Enron entity that was the general partner of Whitewing. REP. STRICKLAND: Would it be possible for you to identify for the committee the individuals who were involved in running this? MS. WATKINS: The administrative running of Whitewing was under Mr. Andrew Fastow, and I believe he had Cheryl Lipshoots (ph) running the Condor Whitewing structure. REP. STRICKLAND: Okay. Now, Enron sold these assets to Whitewing at book value? MS. WATKINS: Yes. REP. STRICKLAND: Compared to market value, is book value a reliable indicator of an asset\'s true worth? MS. WATKINS: The transactions were supposed to be sold into Whitewing at market value. I believe they were all transacted at book value, and we documented the fact that book values were close approximations of market values at that time. REP. DEGETTE: Would the gentleman yield for one second? REP. STRICKLAND: I would yield. REP. DEGETTE: Cheryl Lipshoots (ph) was the secretary to the board of directors of Enron at that time, right? MS. WATKINS: No. REP. DEGETTE: No? Was she employed by Enron? MS. WATKINS: She was employed by Enron under Mr. Fastow -- REP. DEGETTE: Okay, I just wanted to clear that up, that Mr. Fastow was in charge, and Cheryl Lipshoots (ph) was running it, and they were both working for Enron. MS. WATKINS: Yes. REP. DEGETTE: Thank you. Thank you. REP. STRICKLAND: Thank you. I have just a couple more questions, Ms. Watkins. REP. GREENWOOD: You have just a couple of more seconds. REP. STRICKLAND: One more question, Mr. Chairman. Wall Street analysts were beginning to doubt Enron\'s deceptively complex earnings statements, so they began to look at Enron\'s cash flow as a more reliable indicator of the condition of the corporation. To make sure its cash flow appeared proportional to its earnings, Enron decided to increase its cash flow. Is that correct? MS. WATKINS: Yes. REP. GREENWOOD: The time of the gentleman has expired. REP. STRICKLAND: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. REP. GREENWOOD: Ms. Watkins, when you were involved in this transaction to sell assets to Condor, was there a discussion or agreement about whether or not those assets could be sold back and whether there were documents that would reflect that? MS. WATKINS: There were -- as I recall, there were extensive conversations, because Promigas was an important asset for the region. We did not -- we were legally selling it to this Whitewing structure. Legally we were losing control of the asset, and there was a lot of discussion that we wanted it back. We drafted some documents that would be trigger points where the business unit could buy it back. My understanding was that Mr. Causey instructed our business unit that there could be nothing in writing that the business unit could buy it back, or Andersen would not let us have the sale treatment that we were getting in the funds flow statement. REP. GREENWOOD: And that was the purpose of that -- MS. WATKINS: Yes -- REP. GREENWOOD: -- because you would -- if the charade was evident, you wouldn\'t be able to get a tax treatment? The chair recognizes the gentleman from Illinois, Mr. Rush, for 10 minutes. REP. RUSH: I want to thank you, Mr. Chairman, and Ms. Watkins. It\'s very pleasing that you are here. Your testimony has been forthright and I would say without any kind of a value in term\'s of Ms. Temple\'s testimony, it\'s diametrically opposed to the kind of testimony that Ms. Temple presented to this committee, and it is certainly appreciated by the committee -- at least one member of the committee, and I believe that it is appreciated -- your testimony is appreciated by the American public. On what date did you first speak with Cindy Olson, or communicate with her in any way about your concerns about the financial condition of Enron? MS. WATKINS: On the afternoon of August 16th, following the all- employee meeting that had been held that day. REP. RUSH: And how many times did you speak with her about your concerns, and approximately during what time period? MS. WATKINS: She encouraged me to meet with Mr. Lay, which I did do. I then subsequently transferred into Ms. Olson\'s group. I did not have lengthy conversations with her after that about my concerns. I had expressed them to Mr. Lay, and I thought that was the best place to discuss them. REP. RUSH: So did you read your various -- or did Ms. Olson rather read your -- the various letters that you sent to Mr. Lay and the attachments? MS. WATKINS: I only showed her the anonymous letter, the one page. I did not provide her with copies of the other memos. If she obtained them elsewhere, I don\'t know. REP. RUSH: And what was her response when you showed her the anonymous letter? MS. WATKINS: She could -- she was -- clearly understood that this was a serious problem, and she said it would be best if I explained it personally to Mr. Lay. REP. RUSH: Okay, at one time did you -- in your earlier testimony you indicated that you had a discussion with Ms. Olson about Mr. Fastow\'s desire to have you terminated. At what point in the aforementioned series of discussions did you have that -- express that concern to Ms. Olson? MS. WATKINS: When I met with Mr. Lay on the 22nd, I was leaving for a small vacation that Friday, coming back the following Thursday. When I came into the office August 30th, I had messages to immediately go see Ms. Olson. And that is when she told me that Mr. Fastow had wanted to have me fired and wanted to seize my computer. REP. RUSH: Okay. Did she in any way indicate to you how the attitude displayed by Mr. Fastow -- I mean, was he -- did she -- his demeanor? Or how did she exactly -- how did she relate to you what he had said? What was his frame of mind, if you could? MS. WATKINS: She didn\'t give me a lot of details. She just said that he was behaving in a way that was somewhat shocking to her as well as Mr. Lay. REP. RUSH: And what is Ms. Olson\'s relationship with the Enron Corporation? MS. WATKINS: I believe she\'s a senior vice president, or an executive vice president. REP. RUSH: Is she associated at all with the stock fund at Enron? MS. WATKINS: I was not aware of it. I have since seen in some testimony that she is a trustee, but I was not aware of her position with regards to the 401(k) plan. REP. RUSH: And if she was a trustee at the time, when this all was occurring, do you think that she had any fiduciary obligation to at the very least make an investigation into your claims, concerning your claims? MS. WATKINS: I think she probably understood that they were being investigated and by a professional law firm. And I am sure she was waiting to see the results of that investigation. REP. RUSH: And can you be more specific about your concern -- what you said to her about your concerns about Enron\'s financing? I mean, what was her responses to you? Did you -- how did she respond, and did she indicate in any way that she had heard these same kind of concerns from other Enron employees? MS. WATKINS: Well, after Enron declared bankruptcy, or even as we were heading up to it, she seemed to indicate that no one could have seen this coming. She said in fact that I was the only one that had any kind of inkling that we were in the bad condition that we were in. So I don\'t think she had evidence from anyone else, or opinions from anyone else about our condition. REP. RUSH: My time is running down, but I really -- I want to -- if you could just explain to the committee about the culture there at Enron. It seems to me that everybody from the president to the parking lot know that there was -- the parking lot attendant -- knew that there was something going on there. I mean, what -- explain to us about the culture that was prevalent there in the company. MS. WATKINS: Well, I certainly think it was fairly well known about the Raptor transactions within the global finance unit and within the business units that hedged with Raptor. I don\'t think it was well known throughout the company. And the culture -- I mean, Enron was voted most innovative. It was voted one of the best places to work. I mean, it was the job to have in Houston. The atmosphere was electric. It was fun. You were surrounded by bright people, energized - change the world. It was -- you felt somewhat invincible. And, yes, people were arrogant, and it was -- did have a trader kind of mentality that was sometimes tough to live with. But it was always a fun place to work. REP. RUSH: And the -- most people were conscious about their upward mobility in the company, and they thought that the company would be a place to move up fairly quickly? And -- is that -- MS. WATKINS: Everyone was very conscious of what they were contributing in the last six months. The performance ranking system judged you on what you contributed to the company in the last six months -- no old tapes. And so -- and in that sense it was very competitive. REP. RUSH: And Mr. Fastow and Mr. Skilling and others could very easily manipulate that type of concern to help people to overlook some of the transgressions that we are looking into right now? Is that your opinion? MS. WATKINS: Enron paid its people very well. The stock had been performing very well. I think there was a concern by most people that you didn\'t want to rock the boat. REP. RUSH: Do you have any relationship, either a subsequent relationship to the bankruptcy to some of the Enron employees who had been fired from Enron, some of the lower-level employees? MS. WATKINS: I mean, I know several people who have been let go. REP. RUSH: And do you -- there\'s an issue regarding your severance pay. Are you familiar with -- MS. WATKINS: Or lack thereof? REP. RUSH: Lack thereof, right. Can you expound on what you think is the problem with their severance pay and what is the -- why is it at this point in time there are some former Enron employees who have made tremendous amounts of money and who have very generous severance pay, and then there are others who have been forced to live in ways that they\'d never imagined that they would have to live because of the fact that they don\'t have the severance pay. Can you -- do you see a problem there, and what\'s the nature of the problem, and how would you recommend that we go about resolving that issue here? MS. WATKINS: Well, recently it was disclosed -- maybe at salon.com -- but the retention bonuses that were paid the week before the bankruptcy. And the amounts I find -- some of the amounts I find shocking for 90 days retention. And I do not believe that it was in the best interests of creditors to -- yes, we should retain certain people, but I don\'t think they needed to be paid three and four times their base salary to stay for 90 days. And I think it is an insult to the 4,000 people that were let go with $4,000 checks that there are a handful of people -- more than a handful -- that were paid $600,000, a million five, two million -- $450,000 -- I mean, gargantuan sums of money to agree to stay at Enron for 90 days. I am appalled by that list. REP. RUSH: Thank you. I yield back, Mr. Chairman. REP. GREENWOOD: The chair thanks the gentleman, and recognizes the gentleman from Iowa, Mr. Ganske, for 10 minutes. REP. GANSKE: Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and thank you, Ms. Watkins, for coming to the committee. You know, I am outraged at what has happened with Enron -- employees, pensioners, investors -- they have seen their nest eggs disappear, and they speak about unbearable grief. In Iowa we had -- I\'ve spoken to a lot of former employees of the natural gas company that was based in Omaha, merged with the Houston Natural Gas Company, and became Enron, and they have lost everything. I mean, there was even a suicide when a former executive who left the company with millions couldn\'t deal with the collapse of the company. So this is really serious. I do not think this is -- the problems we are seeing with Enron are just an issue of corporate greed in one company. I think that we are seeing problems with companies like Global Crossing, Elan (ph) -- they took -- you know, gave the money to someone else, took some of it back, counted the income as revenue without counting the outgo as expense. Amazon has resorted to pro forma accounting. Shares in Tyco dropped 50 percent on questions of its accounting. So this is a big, big deal -- the biggest bankruptcy in our nation\'s history. I applaud the chairman of the full committee and the chairman of this investigative committee on doing this. Now, Ms. Watkins, just briefly, in a minute, tell me, what was your job around the time that you went to Ken Lay? What were you supposed to be doing for the company? MS. WATKINS: I was gathering a list of all assets that we might consider for sale and looking at the economic impact of sale. So I was looking at the book value, the market value, what kind of gain or loss we might get if we were able to sell that asset for its market value. REP. GANSKE: So you started -- with that information, you started to piece together this whole scenario. Is that what happened? MS. WATKINS: Well, yes, because a number of assets were hedged with Raptor. And my understanding of a hedge is that means you\'ve got a locked-in sales value. And so some of these assets, most notably Avici and New Power, had -- the market values were significant below our book value. But since we had the assets hedged, that should have been really no concern of Enron\'s. It should have been edged with Raptor. And the business units that were helping me pull together this information kept showing me losses that should have been Raptor\'s that were coming back to Enron. REP. GANSKE: Okay. Were you also hearing, you know, scuttlebutt around the company about some of these things that you were seeing? MS. WATKINS: Not accounting impropriety scuttlebutt; just -- REP. GANSKE: Did you ever hear, you know, at the water cooler about somebody who made an investment of $10,000, $15,000, and got millions? MS. WATKINS: No, I did not. REP. GANSKE: Okay. So you\'re gathering all this information together. Did you ever have any trouble getting the information? MS. WATKINS: On the structures and the way they actually worked, no, I did not. It was readily apparent people had various analyses and presentations that they provided me. REP. GANSKE: So then you write a letter to Ken Lay and you say, ""I am incredibly nervous that we will implode in a wave of impending scandals."" I want to read this full paragraph. ""Is there a way our accounting gurus can unwind these deals now? I have thought and thought about how to do this, but I keep bumping into one big problem. We booked the Condor and Raptor deals in 1999 and 2000. We enjoyed a wonderfully high stock price while many executives sold stock. We then try and reverse and fix the deals in 2001, and it\'s a bit like robbing the bank in one year and trying to pay it back two years later. Nice try, but investors were hurt. They bought at $70 to $80 a share, looking for $120, and now they\'re at $38 or worse. We are under too much scrutiny, and there are probably one or two disgruntled (redeployed?) employees who know enough about the funny accounting to get us into trouble."" When you wrote this letter to Mr. Lay, what was going through your mind? Were you afraid? MS. WATKINS: Well, I wanted to impress upon him that this was something that was likely to happen. We were downsizing. We had at this point maybe let go at least 400 or 500 people. REP. GANSKE: But this is bad news, okay, and you\'re writing this -- you originally wrote this anonymously. MS. WATKINS: Yes. REP. GANSKE: Okay, this is really bad stuff. I mean, were you worried that if you go to the president with this type of stuff that this could affect you personally? MS. WATKINS: I certainly was not going to go to Mr. Skilling. I believed and I still believe that Mr. Lay is a man of integrity. He didn\'t shoot the messenger. I\'m still at Enron. And I felt like I could bring the concerns to him. REP. GANSKE: Did you put a personal copy of this somewhere outside of the company? Did you keep a copy of this memo somewhere else? MS. WATKINS: I did. On the day I sent it to Mr. Lay anonymously, I also sent it in an envelope to Mr. McMahon with my name on it. And I talked to him about it that day. REP. GANSKE: Did you keep a copy for your own personal files? MS. WATKINS: Yes, I did. Yes, I did. REP. GANSKE: And where did you keep those files? At home? MS. WATKINS: No. REP. GANSKE: At work? MS. WATKINS: No, in a lock box. REP. GANSKE: In a lock box. So you were enough concerned about this that you wanted to put this somewhere where it couldn\'t be destroyed. MS. WATKINS: Yes. REP. GANSKE: Were you worried about your own personal safety? MS. WATKINS: at times, I mean, just because the company was a little bit radio-silent back to me, so I didn\'t know how they were taking my memos or the investigation. REP. GANSKE: Why would you be worried about your personal safety? MS. WATKINS: Because it was the seventh-largest company in America. REP. GANSKE: And you were dealing with a really powerful problem -- MS. WATKINS: Yes. REP. GANSKE: -- and a really powerful company. I just have to ask you this. When you first learned about this problem at Enron, did you own stock? MS. WATKINS: I have stock in the 401(k) plan and I have stock options. REP. GANSKE: Did you sell any of that stock? MS. WATKINS: Yes, I did. REP. GANSKE: When did you sell it? MS. WATKINS: I sold -- well, I routinely diversified and did not hold that much Enron stock or stock options. I did sell $31,000 worth of stock in late August, and then I sold -- (met?) to myself around $17,000 of stock options in early October. REP. GANSKE: And you sent these memos to Mr. Lay when? MS. WATKINS: August 15th. REP. GANSKE: So around the time that you sent these memos, after you had gathered this data and gotten to know the financial situation of the company, you sold some stock. Why did you sell it? MS. WATKINS: Well, I mean, I could have sold in July at $45. I actually sold in October more out of a knee-jerk reaction to September 11th. When the markets reopened after the terrorist attacks, most stocks did decline. Enron declined into the low 20s. I had virtually no stock options that were in the money in the low 20s. In early October we moved into the mid-30s and even high 30s, and I had two blocks of stock options that were then in the money. And I just -- I think, as many others, I felt some panic and need to get cash, because you just felt like, you know, when was the next attack? What would that impact be on the stock market? REP. GANSKE: So you sold $31,000 at one time and $17,000 at another time? MS. WATKINS: Yes. REP. GANSKE: So $47,000. When you found out -- when you gave the second memo and had the meetings with Mr. Lay -- and then, as we\'ve heard from testimony today, you know, you were concerned that, you know, going back to the same law firm kind of looked like it was a cover-up; things weren\'t happening too much -- did you ever think about, you know, going to Treasury, Justice, the SEC, blowing the whistle on this? This is -- you know, you\'ve outlined potentially criminal behavior. MS. WATKINS: A co-worker of mine asked whether or not -- she knew I had done this, and she asked whether or not I\'d consider going to the SEC on this. And I said, you know, ""I don\'t want to hasten our demise. There are 20,000 employees here whose livelihood is at risk. And if it appears that I hastened the demise of the company, I might be targeted by them. They might confuse the problem as something I caused."" You know, I did not want to hasten the demise. REP. GANSKE: When you had your conversations with Mr. Lay, did he ask you not to share this information with anyone? MS. WATKINS: He did ask me, had I taken it outside? Had I taken it to the SEC or the press? And I said no, I had not done so. And he said, ""Can you please give us time to investigate?"" And I said, ""Oh, most definitely."" REP. GANSKE: Did he give you a timeline? Did you ask him for a timeline? MS. WATKINS: I did not ask him for a timeline, but he seemed to indicate that they would look into it rather quickly. REP. GANSKE: Well, we all know -- and you, as an accountant, could see the problems coming. I mean, you wrote about an impending implosion. This must have weighed quite heavily on your mind in terms of thinking about, well, what happened both to your fellow employees, as they were locked in, and investors around the country. Tell me what you were feeling about that time -- MS. WATKINS: Well -- REP. GANSKE: -- specifically on whether you had an ethical obligation to let this be known. MS. WATKINS: I don\'t -- I wasn\'t thinking legally. I really felt like I could not go outside of the company. Enron was full of bright people. There were maybe calm ways of addressing this. I mean, having it hit the press in an inflammatory way would definitely hasten the demise. And I wanted to make sure that we had researched everything thoroughly, because what I wanted to do was restate, come clean, but with some contingency plans, how to make sure our trade counter- parties had confidence in our survival, maybe shore up some equity and finance deals, knowing that we were going to face hard times. But just to go to the press or to go to the SEC would have not given Enron a chance to try to fix it calmly. And most definitely this news would have been inflammatory and we would be in the same position we\'re in right now. REP. GREENWOOD: The time of the gentleman has expired. REP. GANSKE: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. REP. GREENWOOD: Before I go to the next -- before I recognize Mr. Markey for questions, I just want you to clarify something, Ms. Watkins. The Powers report indicated that you had not cooperated or had not participated in that investigation. Is that the case? MS. WATKINS: Well, not actually. They called me for the very first time December 13th and wanted to interview me the following week. I was actually a little surprised that it took them so long to -- REP. GREENWOOD: It took two months; is that right? MS. WATKINS: -- call me. Yes. REP. GREENWOOD: Any indication why it took them two months, since you were so central? MS. WATKINS: I had just hired Mr. Hilder. Enron was offering an attorney to represent me that was also representing Mr. Causey and Mr. Buy. I was not comfortable using that attorney. So I had spoken with Mr. Hilder. He was not up to speed yet on the issues. So we did meet with the special committee the week before Christmas, but just to say that we needed to reschedule. They indicated that they were trying to look at evidence first before they conducted interviews. REP. GREENWOOD: The chair recognizes the gentleman from Massachusetts, Mr. Markey, for 10 minutes. REP. ED MARKEY (D-MA): Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you, Ms. Watkins. Pinocchio had a conscience called Jiminy Cricket. Every time Pinocchio ignored Jiminy Cricket, his nose grew longer and longer. You were the conscience of this corporation. You warned them. And when they ignored your advice, they had to tell more lies. And the longer they told those lies, the more jeopardy that investors and employees of Enron were placed in. Now, what you have done is really very courageous. You\'re a hero. But being a whistleblower is something that can test the strength of the strongest person. It can buckle their knees. And I have a feeling that this is just the beginning of a process for you in terms of the stress that you\'re going to be under. I just want you to know that, for my part -- and I think I speak for every member of this committee -- that if actions that you feel are unwarranted are being taken against you because of what you\'re doing here, that you should let us know. They did the same thing to the Morton Thiacol whistleblowers that spoke of the O-ring. They demoted them. They punished them. But once Congress intervened, that was rectified within a day. So you should let us know that. Now, in both your August 15th and August 22nd letters to Mr. Lay, you warn that, quote, ""We do not have valuation issues"" -- I\'m sorry -- ""We do have valuation issues with our international assets, and possibly some of our Enron energy services mark-to-market positions."" Now, we know that Enron has created thousands of special-purpose entities. Do you believe that there may be some mark-to-market valuation problems involving transactions with any of these other special-purpose entities that were constructed? MS. WATKINS: I don\'t believe so. I mean, a number of the special-purpose entities that Enron has are somewhat routine. Enron did hire the best and the brightest, and a lot of them were structured so if we did want to sell an international power plant, we had a number of subsidiaries that might appeal to a European buyer, an Asian buyer. Some of them were very legitimate just to allow us all the options that we might want to pursue sometime in the future. REP. MARKEY: How about Enron\'s international assets? Do you think there could be some mark-to-market valuation problems there? MS. WATKINS: Not so much mark-to-market. But in accounting, if you have a long-term asset on your balance sheet that you feel is permanently impaired, you must write that down. And I believe there may be some problems with some of Enron\'s international assets. REP. MARKEY: How does that problem manifest itself? MS. WATKINS: If it appears that you will not achieve, over time, the value you have paid for a particular asset, you must write it down. So that would be an income statement impact, when you realize you\'ve got the valuation problems. REP. MARKEY: So, in other words, if they mark to the model and it turns out the model\'s not working -- MS. WATKINS: That\'s on our fair-value assets. REP. MARKEY: Right. MS. WATKINS: Most of the international assets were not necessarily fair-value assets. Those tended to be the domestic ones. So we do have some domestic assets that are fair value that are marked to a model that is somewhat subjective. REP. MARKEY: Okay. Now, Mr. Skilling has told us that he wasn\'t involved in the March 2001 Raptor transactions. The Powers Committee reports that others at Enron say he was. And Powers is critical of Mr. Skilling\'s failure to assure that the Raptor losses were properly accounted for in the first quarter of 2001. Do you have any knowledge of Mr. Skilling\'s involvement with or participation in the Raptor vehicles? MS. WATKINS: No, I do not. REP. MARKEY: You do not. Now, on October of 2000, Mr. Fastow convened a meeting of the LJM partners to review their activities. Mr. Skilling is listed as a guest speaker. On page seven of the presentation documentation for this meeting, Mr. Fastow says that the reason Enron needs private equity is because, quote, ""Energy and communications assets typically do not generate earnings or cash flow within the first one to three years, and investments dilute Enron\'s current earnings per share and its credit rating ratios."" Do you agree with that? MS. WATKINS: I mean, not all energy and communication assets don\'t generate cash flow, but I guess he means Enron\'s energy and communication assets were not generating cash flow. REP. MARKEY: Yes. Then you agree with that. MS. WATKINS: Yes. REP. MARKEY: Now, the proposed solution in that document was, quote, ""to deconsolidate assets"" and, quote, ""create structures which accelerate projected earnings and cash flows."" Now, you had run the JEDI partnership and had sold the Colombian asset to White Wing to increase cash flow. Would you agree that this was the purpose of Enron\'s SPE? MS. WATKINS: The purpose of the Condor SPE appeared, in my opinion, to be to generate funds flow. As far as LJM, I\'m mainly familiar just with Raptor and the Raptor special-purpose entities, and it does appear that those were created solely to ensure that certain losses that should flow through our income statement were masked. REP. MARKEY: All right, if you could turn to page nine, where it states that private equity can also be used for, quote, ""earnings generation."" You found that to be true on the Raptors\' SPEs, didn\'t you? MS. WATKINS: Yes. REP. MARKEY: You did. Now, Mr. Skilling told us under oath that while he was at Enron, he was not aware of, quote -- this is what he told the committee -- ""any financing arrangements designed to conceal liabilities or inflate profitability"" and that, again quote, ""the off- balance-sheet entities or SPEs that have gotten so much attention are commonplace in corporate America and, if properly established, they can effectively shift risk from a company\'s shareholders to others who have a different risk-reward preference. As a result, the financial statements issued by Enron, as far as I know"" -- this is Mr. Skilling speaking -- ""accurately reflected the financial condition of the company."" So, in your opinion, was Raptor IV, quote, ""a financing arrangement designed to conceal liabilities or inflate profitability""? MS. WATKINS: I would focus in on his comment that we did these deals to shift risk and return to an entity that wanted to bear that differing risk and return. So the risk-and-return scenario that Enron didn\'t want to bear transferred to a special-purpose entity. But we know from the Powers report that there was no real economic risk transferred to Raptor. REP. MARKEY: Do you believe that he knew the actual financial condition of the company? Mr. Skilling, that is. MS. WATKINS: Yes, I do. REP. MARKEY: You do. Here on the LJM2 approval sheet, we have Skilling signing off at tab two. Doesn\'t that mean to you that Mr. Skilling was involved in Raptor? MS. WATKINS: On these transactions, where he is signing off, he should be. I mean, I\'m looking at one that says, ""Jeff Skilling/Joe Sutton"" with no signature, but maybe it was -- oh. I don\'t know who that is (to find it?). I mean, if there was a signature block on these sheets, it had to be filled. REP. MARKEY: So that would be back on first, second -- page three -- fourth page. It says, ""LJM Approval Page 3,"" and the bottom is executive Jeff Skilling, with his signature next to it, March 12th, 2001. Can you see that? MS. WATKINS: March 12th, 2001. That\'s under tab 2? REP. MARKEY: Yes, it\'s under tab 2, page 3. MS. WATKINS: Yes. REP. MARKEY: Now, what does that indicate inside the corporate structure, as you know it, when a signature like that is under -- MS. WATKINS: Well, he is approving Raptor 4. And I am sure he was well versed with what this meant. REP. MARKEY: You\'re sure? MS. WATKINS: He typically was very well versed. REP. MARKEY: So in your opinion then at the very top of the company these men were well briefed with regard to what was going on inside these special purpose entities? MS. WATKINS: It would be my opinion that Mr. Skilling would be very well briefed about these transactions. REP. MARKEY: Well, again, I thank you. And, Mr. Chairman, I thank you for your courtesies in the last several years -- REP. GREENWOOD: I thank the gentleman -- REP. MARKEY: --and I thank you, Ms. Watkins, for your courage. REP. GREENWOOD: Before recognizing the gentleman from Texas, the chair is going to exercise the prerogative -- the chair has to turn the gavel over to someone else. But, Ms. Watkins, in your interview with V&E, you discussed that Fastow was in effect blackmailing banks to become investors in LJM. What did you mean by that? MS. WATKINS: I had heard from friends that worked at Chase and Credit Suisse and Bank of America that Andy was -- Mr. Fastow was almost somewhat threatening -- that if you didn\'t invest in LJM, Enron would not use you as a banker or an investment banker again, that he was threatening the institutions that to get Enron business they should invest in LJM. REP. GREENWOOD: Okay. Did t hat appear to be a successful strategy? MS. WATKINS: By the investors that are in LJM2, yes, it appeared to work. REP. GREENWOOD: How about Mr. McMahon? Was he -- he taught us about promises that were made to the banks. Was he -- did he participate in that ? MS. WATKINS: Well, I just remember from his testimony that he was asked about -- REP. GREENWOOD: Did you discus this issue with McMahon? MS. WATKINS: I -- he and I discussed that Mr. Fastow used strong-arm tactics occasionally. REP. GREENWOOD: The chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas, Mr. Green, for 10 minutes. REP. GREEN: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And, Ms. Watkins, if you\'ll -- I\'ll have some questions. But, first, I had somebody from Houston send me an e-mail -- well, it actually came from another member of Congress, and the young lady actually works in Houston. And she said this: Capitalism is if you have two cows and you sell one and you buy a bull and y our herd multiplies, and the economy grows, and you sell them to retire on the income. And now you have Enron capitalism. You have two cows -- you sell three of them to your publicly-listed company, using letters of credit opened by your brother-in-law at the bank; then execute a dead equity swap from an associate general officer, so you get all four cows backs with tax exemptions for five. The milk rights of the six cows are transferred via an intermediary to a Cayman Island company secretly owned by your CFO, who sells the rights to all seven cows back to your listed company. And the annual report says the company owns eight cows, with an option for six more. When I saw this late last night -- of course we ran until three o\'clock. And I thought, After hearing all the testimony that we\'ve heard before today, that\'s about what it sounds like. And your testimony is very refreshing in all honesty. And, like a lot of members, I respect you and admire you to be willing to put your job on the line, to go up to the CEO and say, you know, We have a problem. And after reading Vinson and Elkins\' response, they didn\'t respond like it should have been, and your testimony has already shown that. Let me turn if you could to tab 2 in your book -- and what it is is your memo that you sent to Mr. Hecker -- because our first hearing we actually had Arthur Andersen here and talked about your memo. Were you surprised? I know as a former Arthur Andersen how quickly Mr. Hecker communicated your concerns to Andersen\'s management? MS. WATKINS: Yes, I think -- I\'m looking at tab 16, and it\'s a memo from Mr. James Hecker, dated August 21st. I phoned him as he says -- REP. GREEN: Okay, yes, it\'s tab 2 on mine -- tab 16 on yours. MS. WATKINS: I phoned him, as it says -- more like a sounding board to talk to him about my concerns before I met with Mr. Lay. I -- you know, I was thinking it was just something between us. In hindsight I realize the severity of what I was concerned about was something that probably would induce him to do something about it. And I read this when this committee released this document a few weeks ago. REP. GREEN: And when you spoke with him and you told me you thought it would be confidential, or just between you and him? MS. WATKINS: Well, I didn\'t say confidential necessarily -- but I was just trying to run some things by him. And it -- I did not realize he had written a memo until this year. REP. GREEN: I guess in most organizations though if somebody brings something to my attention that impacts my company or partnership in this case, you know, I\'m -- I would expect him to be able to go to someone else and say, By the way, there\'s a problem that has been brought up, and it\'s my job to pass this on so somebody in a decision-making capacity higher than mine can do it. How long did you work with Arthur Andersen? MS. WATKINS: Eight years. REP. GREEN: Oh, so it was a number of years. And was it your experience that the practice groups tended to be sensitive about internal allegations of accounting irregularities during your eight years? MS. WATKINS: If I was still an auditor at Arthur Andersen and I got a call I guess like mine, I would be highly concerned with the conversation and the topics that I brought up with Mr. Hecker. So -- REP. GREEN: So, it would circulate in the office, and -- MS. WATKINS: I mean, it doesn\'t surprise me that he, that after reading this, he talked to the people that he did, and that he did try to bring a lot of attention to my concerns. REP. GREEN: And did you -- were you surprised that it actually made it all the way up to Chicago? MS. WATKINS: Not really. I mean, Mr. Hecker indicated to me during our call that he hoped I wasn\'t right, because he didn\'t think their firm could stand another scandal, following Waste Management and Sunbeam. REP. GREEN: Yeah, and we discussed that before at our hearings. I guess the Andersen folks who were here developed some type of ""I- don\'t-remember"" and ""I-don\'t-recall"" illnesses that it seems like people get when they come into our committee room. And when you worked at Arthur Andersen -- you know, I appreciate your insights in that, because on what\'s happened -- but it seemed like they weren\'t as forthcoming as maybe they should have been, having been notified last August. And maybe even questioned before your memo to Mr. Hecker. In most of your memos you almost always provided an additional list of people to speak with about collaborating your views. And you have been documenting, saying, This is just my opinion, but here\'s other folks that can collaborate. Are there people in the Enron food chain that -- who would be helpful to our subcommittee to talk to that maybe we haven\'t had the opportunity, or our investigators? Is there anyone that you know of that you may not have shared with our committee staff? MS. WATKINS: I think I\'ve mentioned most of the names to the staff, and also here today, that would be useful. REP. GREEN: Okay. Let me -- another question, and if you\'ll turn to page 37. Okay, I\'m sorry -- tab 26, the agenda for the LJM investments from October the 26th, 2000, annual partnership meeting. MS. WATKINS: Okay. REP. GREEN: I know that you haven\'t seen this document before, but I think you can shed some light on this for us. Now, on page 37 of this report, ""sample investments, Raptor 1."" Their first bullet points to, or reads in relevant part, that Raptor is structured, financed or capitalized with Enron stock derivative and LJM equity that will enter into derivative transactions with Enron related to investments in Enron\'s merchant investment portfolio. How can an entity that is capitalized with Enron stock derivatives legitimately enter into a derivative transaction with Enron? And how can Enron book that income from these transactions? MS. WATKINS: Well, the main issue too was that it was primarily capitalized with an Enron stock derivative, and the LJM equity had been completely offset by a cash fee paid to LJM. So under that structure, I don\'t see how it could have been legitimate. REP. GREEN: Okay. And, again, this is the annual partnership meeting of October of 2000. In your memo in August, and what we have seen from the Powers Report that there was even information in the spring of 2001 -- so you know it was before your memo. And now we have the original, the annual partnership meeting -- and I have to admit I was a business major, but I couldn\'t make heads or tails about how you could quantify this. I appreciate your answer. On page 38, ""sample investments, Osprey,"" the first bullet point reads, the relevant part, that Osprey is a partner and an investment vehicle that purchases merchant assets from Enron. It\'s capitalized with 50 million shares of Enron stock. If an entity were capitalized with Enron stock, and Enron sold assets to that entity, is Enron essentially selling assets to itself again? MS. WATKINS: This -- Osprey and Condor and Whitewing are all the same vehicle, and this is the Condor that I was referring to in my memos that I was uncomfortable with. REP. GREEN: So, to answer the question, if the entity were capitalized with Enron stock, and Enron sold assets to the entity, is Enron essentially selling assets to itself? MS. WATKINS: In this instance there were significant outside investors -- REP. GREEN: Okay. MS. WATKINS: -- and they could fall back on the assets for repayment. But it was also a structure that if the assets were not sufficient to repay the debt investors, they also had the stock. Supposedly this is a legitimate accounting structure. I\'m not happy with it. I think if there is a clawback (ph) to the company to its own stock it should not be off-balance-sheet. And the debt that came into Condor, or Whitewing, or Osprey, was used to purchase assets. And Enron got funds flow from operations treatment from that. And I think if it had been a consolidated special purpose entities it would have been funds flow from borrowings. And those are two very different funds flow items in terms of how an analyst would evaluate the company. REP. GREEN: The second bullet points out that this structure creates a synthetic multi-billion-dollar balance sheet for Enron that deconsolidated assets to generate funds flow. If in fact these structures created synthetic balance sheets for Enron that indicate an increase in funds flow, would this be intentionally deceptive to investors in your opinion? MS. WATKINS: Yes, in my opinion it would. REP. GREEN: Ms. Watkins, you said earlier that the push to sell assets and increase cash flow began in the third and fourth quarters of 1999? MS. WATKINS: Yes, sir. REP. GREEN: So now a year and a half later in its continued effort to artificially increase its cash flow, Enron is selling its assets at inflated prices to partnerships, of which its senior executives are the general partners. These partnerships are either capitalized with or guaranteed by Enron stock, and this was done to improve the optics of Enron\'s balance sheet in order to deceiving Wall Street analysts and investors? I know that\'s a long phrase, but do you think these -- in your opinion -- these partnerships were either capitalized or guaranteed this was done to improve the optics -- and I love the terminology -- the optics of the Enron balance sheets to deceive Wall Street analysts and investors? MS. WATKINS: It appears that some of these vehicles were used for financial statement manipulation. REP. GREEN: Okay. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Again, thank you for being here. And I have been proud to read the articles about a Texas lady who is willing to do that. REP. TAUZIN: I thank the gentleman. I think we have gone through the roster of members qualified to ask questions. I want to acknowledge for the record, however, the presence once again of Congresswoman Sheila Jackson Lee, who is not a member of our committee, and therefore not entitled to participate with questions, but who has been an extraordinary participant through all these hearing processes, on behalf of the citizens of her committee who have been so devastated by this collapse. And, again, Congresswoman Lee, we welcome you, and thank you for your attendance, and your participation physically, and I know emotionally in these hearings as well. Thank you. Let me before we wrap put a few questions into the record, Ms. Watkins, that I think are important as well because I think the answers will tell us a little bit about who was taking responsibility for what was going on and who was not. And I want to focus on the gentleman who held the position of executive vice president and chief risk officer. And would you describe for us the function of the chief risk officer in the corporation? MS. WATKINS: Mr. Buy supervised our credit department. REP. TAUZIN: And his name is Rick Buy, right? MS. WATKINS: Rick Buy, yes. He supervised our credit department, our risk assessment and control group, and he was in charge of our risk management policy that was presented to the board each year. REP. TAUZIN: So he was, according to our documents, responsible for identifying, quantifying, controlling the risk in both Enron\'s trading activities and their investment opportunities, right? MS. WATKINS: Yes. REP. TAUZIN: This would include all these special entities and partnerships that Enron was engaged in, right? MS. WATKINS: Yes, that\'s correct. REP. TAUZIN: Now, did you ever have a conversation with him about the precarious financial condition of Enron and its reliance upon these questionable deals to continue to meet the earnings projections? MS. WATKINS: I had worked with Mr. Buy during the time period where I was managing the JEDI portfolio. I have also had discussions with him -- you know, he was a former co-worker and friend. The week leading up to my meeting with Mr. Lay, Mr. Buy was on vacation, and I actually phoned him. I was trying to use him as a sounding board as well. I told him a bit about my concerns, and that I had a meeting scheduled with Mr. Lay. I asked him if I could fax him my materials to get his opinion of my concerns. REP. TAUZIN: Now, did you tell him that in fact some of the materials had come from his own shop? MS. WATKINS: No, but I just told him I had some memos that I wanted to fax him, and have him look at. REP. TAUZIN: Which -- did you identify those memos or explain to him what they might say or -- MS. WATKINS: I told him I was very concerned about the Raptor transactions, that we have very large accounting issues, and that it was not appropriate to be backstopping these Raptor losses with Enron stock. REP. TAUZIN: So you offered to send him all this. What was his response? MS. WATKINS: He said he\'d rather not see it. REP. TAUZIN: Now, he would rather not see it? And his job was the risk officer for the corporation? MS. WATKINS: Yes, sir. REP. TAUZIN: And so I suppose you didn\'t send it to him them? MS. WATKINS: No, I did not. REP. TAUZIN: So the chief risk officer of the corporation was sort of in a see no evil, hear no evil, speak no evil position? MS. WATKINS: It would appear so. REP. TAUZIN: He didn\'t want to see the documents? MS. WATKINS: It would appear that would be the case. REP. TAUZIN: Now, did he tell you anything about -- at any time -- about the precarious financial condition of Enron, and its reliance upon these deals? MS. WATKINS: Mr. Buy expressed the opinion to me, you know, as early as maybe even 1997-98, that he felt that Enron was one or two quarters away from disaster. Now, he had different reasons for that, but that was because we were a trading company. Trading companies usually -- it\'s hard to predict earnings. You have to depend upon volatility in the marketplace. And we were so dead-set on predicting our earnings, and the Street had become accustomed to us predicting our earnings -- so he just felt like if we ever missed our earnings targets people -- i.e., the analysts and the investing community -- would look at us with a -- under a microscope, so to speak, and that he was concerned that that would put us in, as he put it, in a disastrous position. REP. TAUZIN: So here is the chief risk officer, who has expressed to you concerns that you may be a quarter away from disaster because of your reliance, Enron\'s reliance upon these transactions, who says to you, Don\'t send to me the documents illustrating your concerns that there are serious problems with these transactions -- who did you react to that? MS. WATKINS: I was disappointed, because I felt like he was in a position to , you know, help us disclose these things with Mr. Lay. REP. TAUZIN: And you weren\'t getting any help at all from him? MS. WATKINS: Right. REP. TAUZIN: Now, you were part of an investor conference call on October 23rd. Now, to put it in perspective, this is about the time that you were discussing with Mr. Lay your concerns and bringing them to his attention? MS. WATKINS: Well, it was after the earnings release, which talked about the $1.2 billion shareholder reduction. REP. TAUZIN: October 16th, right? MS. WATKINS: October 16th. We had an October 23rd investor call that was open to the public, and I just listened in. REP. TAUZIN: Right. And now I understand that Mr. Causey and Mr. Lay were members of that conference call. MS. WATKINS: Yes, that\'s right. REP. TAUZIN: And you had a chance to listen in to the conversations. Was the Raptors discussed in that conference call? MS. WATKINS: Yes. An analyst asked the question: Okay, Enron has unwound these Raptor transactions, you\'ve written off the transactions in the third quarter of 2001; if they had never existed at all, what would have been the income statement impact for the year 2000? And Mr. Causey responded that there would have been little or not impact, because we could have done these transactions elsewhere. REP. TAUZIN: Was that a true statement? MS. WATKINS: I don\'t think so, and the Powers Report doesn\'t think so either. REP. TAUZIN: Did Mr. Lay have any comments on that point? MS. WATKINS: Well, Mr. Lay parroted Mr. Causey word for word, and I felt like that was a statement he didn\'t necessarily know, and it was unwise to parrot the chief accounting officer on that statement. REP. TAUZIN: Now, here Mr. Causey and Mr. Lay are in a conference call with investors, telling them that if the Raptors had not been a part of Enron, that there would have been no impact on the income statement. You believe that not to be true. Did you express your concerns about these statements following that conversation? MS. WATKINS: Well, I did go into Ms. Olson\'s office, and I said, You need to warn Mr. Lay that he should not make comments like that unless he knows it to be a fact. REP. TAUZIN: Did you make notes of those conversations? MS. WATKINS: Yes, I did. REP. TAUZIN: Have you supplied those notes to the committee? MS. WATKINS: I have them. I believe my attorney was going to supply them later. REP. TAUZIN: I would appreciate it if you would supply those notes, that we might have them as part of the record. And, without objection, that will be so ordered. One final thing I want to get on the record, Ms. Watkins, that I think is awfully important too. Once you were identified as the author of the anonymous letter you first sent, did any of the executive offices of Enron, the 50th floor up, ever contact you to discuss with you what you had written? Did anybody praise you for coming forward on the 50th floor? Was there a difference between the reaction of Enron employees below the 50th floor as opposed to those in charge on the 50th floor and above? MS. WATKINS: The reaction from the employees that have been laid off has been just fantastic. They are very supportive. And then I would say from 90 percent of the employees that are still there the reaction is also very positive. From the 50th floor, I have only had one person give me an ""atta girl,"" so to speak, and that was Mr. Ray Bowman. REP. TAUZIN: Now -- and one final thing -- this is very important obviously for you and for us. Will you agree to inform us immediately if as a result of your coming forward to testify before this committee, and your willingness to come forward to Mr. Lay with your concerns, as you have, if any retaliatory action is threatened, posed or suggested in terms of your employment and your position with Enron? MS. WATKINS: Yes, sir. REP. TAUZIN: All right. We thank you for that, and we assure you we will be watching that extraordinarily carefully. Are there any requests for additional questions? REP. DEUTSCH: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. REP. TAUZIN: The gentleman from Florida. REP. DEUTSCH: Just a couple of very specific follow-ups. In your discussion with staff yesterday, you stated that you believe that Enron should be taking additional write-offs beyond those in the November 8th restatement. Could you explain that? REP. TAUZIN: Well, the Raptor vehicles that I wrote about that were all associated with LJM 2 -- they were unwound and written off in the third quarter of 2001. And they have yet to be restated. Those should be unwound as if they never existed, and they should restate 2000 results in the first quarter of 2001. REP. DEUTSCH: What\'s the significance of taking additional write-offs, especially Enron is now in bankruptcy proceedings? MS. WATKINS: It\'s the appropriate thing to do for a public company. We are still publicly-traded and under SEC rules. REP. DEUTSCH: And just a couple of very quick follow-up questions. Is it your sense that there was complicity with the auditors, Arthur Andersen, and in a sense with Vinson and Elkins as well, or was there basically fraud to both your accountants and your attorneys? In other words, was this a cooperative effort with Enron management to basically come up with these ideas, or was the representation to the accountants and the attorneys misinformation? MS. WATKINS: It is my opinion that Enron transaction accountants -- most notably Ben Glisson, helped to come up with the structure and come up with a support for the structure, and then convinced Andersen that it worked. REP. DEUTSCH: So they knew -- what you are really saying is that in your opinion they knew it was not that Enron was holding back what the actual structure of the transaction was? MS. WATKINS: Oh, I think they understood the structure, yes. REP. DEUTSCH: And the issues in terms of Enron being the guarantor and all those issues? MS. WATKINS: Yes, yes. REP. DEUTSCH: You mentioned something obviously very disturbing, that you in fact felt for fear of your personal safety. Did you do anything to follow up based on that fear? MS. WATKINS: I did actually talk with some Enron security personnel. I was a little bit concerned that I had -- in effect Mr. Fastow potentially lost his job because, you know, I brought up these concerns. And I actually talked to Enron security personnel about whether I should do anything different -- more concerned that Mr. Fastow might be vindictive. REP. DEUTSCH: Did they give you any advice to take specific action? MS. WATKINS: Just general security advice on -- REP. DEUTSCH: Did Mr. Fastow exhibit any violent behavior or -- MS. WATKINS: No -- REP. DEUTSCH: -- erratic behavior that would -- MS. WATKINS: No, it\'s just I did not feel very much support. I did feel like I was a little bit of a lone fish swimming upstream. And so it starts to wear on you that it\'s you against them, and I was a little bit concerned. REP. DEUTSCH: Are you convinced that Mr. Baxter\'s death is a suicide, or was it possible that there was another more nefarious activity? MS. WATKINS: I\'m sure the authorities will have reported that correctly. REP. DEUTSCH: Is there any doubt in your mind? MS. WATKINS: Probably not. REP. DEUTSCH: Got in your mind about that it was a suicide? MS. WATKINS: Yes, I believe it probably was. REP. DEUTSCH: So if you say probably, there\'s doubt? MS. WATKINS: It\'s just a sensitive topic that I\'d rather not comment on. REP. DEUTSCH: Let me, for the last thing, submit for the record a list of transactions of Enron management. This is something we talked about previously. It\'s actually a list of transactions of sales of Enron stock through the end of last year, totally $1.1 billion -- REP. TAUZIN: Without objection, that will be part of the record. REP. DEUTSCH: -- a total of 17 million shares. You know, obviously none of these shares were sold at zero, at a dollar, at $5, at $10. And I guess these people were wise enough or lucky enough to sell stocks before the facts that you\'ve described and that we\'ve uncovered became public. And it\'s either they were all very lucky, or in fact they were trading on inside information, as it appears from the outside looking in. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. REP. TAUZIN: Thank you very much. I would also ask that the record include the transcript of the conference call referred to in our recent questions as part of the record, and without objection, it is so ordered. The gentleman Mr. Stupak is recognized for questions. REP. STUPAK: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And just a few questions, if I may. But before I do that, I want to thank you, Mr. Chairman, Mr. Dingell, Mr. Deutsch, Mr. Greenwood -- we have had about five or six hearings now. They\'ve been good hearings. We have all been working together on this debacle, if you will, and things have gone quite well. And I would also like to mention our personal staffs, but especially committee staff -- they\'ve worked long and hard to help get us prepared and worked -- I know I appreciate it, and everybody -- REP. TAUZIN: If the gentleman would yield -- REP. STUPAK: Sure I would. REP. TAUZIN: There\'s a personal interest story -- I know he\'s going to get upset with me for telling it, but the gentleman who is in charge of our investigative staff, Mark Paoletta (ph) here, just recently went through lung surgery -- serious lung surgery -- a surgery he was attempting to put off while this investigation was proceeding, and I had to threaten to fire him to make him in fact go to his follow-up, and threaten to fire him if he didn\'t go to the hospital and take care of his lung surgery. He took care of it this weekend, and you can see he\'s back to work already. The staff has done marvelous work, and Mr. Paoletta (ph) particularly accorded our appreciation for his sacrifice of self to get this job done, and we thank you, Mark. I thank the gentleman. REP. STUPAK: And we all appreciate Mark being back and helping throughout this whole ordeal that we have been going through. Ms. Watkins, something has been sort of bugging me, and I\'ve asked this question before, and never really got an answer -- maybe you can shed some light on it. In one of the transactions, Mr. Kopper in a very short period of time, made about $2 million, and the records and everything we have seen said there\'s no reason why he should make $2 million in about two months -- no indication of what was the consideration for the compensation. But yet he made that money, and I believe it was on the Southampton deal, and maybe it was the unwinding of Chewco or something like that. Any -- just how would someone get paid $2 million in this whole deal? I mean, how would you handle that on the books? MS. WATKINS: Well, all I know about those transactions were what I\'ve read in the Powers Report, and I would probably agree with the Powers Report that it does raise questions when you can have such large returns in such a short period of time. REP. STUPAK: Who -- what books handled that loss? The Enron books or Southampton? Would you know? MS. WATKINS: Well, if Enron was purchasing an interest, you know for instance a Chewco interest or whatever, if you are buying back an asset, that goes on your books at the price you paid. So it\'s not an income statement item. It\'s not necessarily a loss for Enron and a gain for Mr. Kopper. It could be an asset purchase by Enron that provided a gain to Mr. Kopper. REP. STUPAK: It sounds like just a way to pass through some money really quickly, right? In -- after you did your memo, and Vinson & Elkins reviewed -- did their investigation, if you will, on or about October 15th, they said that a broader investigation was not necessary and it was just bad cosmetics and we can see our way through that. But then the very next day, on October 16th, is when Enron announced that due to account errors and restructuring related to transactions involving LJM-II, it was revising the shareholder equity numbers downward by $1.2 billion and posting a third quarter loss in excess of $500 million. And, then it went on, and you didn\'t believe at that time, even in spite of the October 16th announcement, that the whole story had been told about the looming financial and accounting crisis involving all these partnerships and these PSEs (sic). And then on November 8th, Enron stated its intent to redo their financial statements for the past four years due to additional accounting problems, again with the LJM and Chewco partnership. Now, despite all these actions, October 15th and October 8th (sic), do you believe that we\'ve learned all the problems that are there, or is there still some things that you believe must be done to really come clean here with the American people and the stock and faith that people had in this company called Enron? MS. WATKINS: Well, I mean, the only people at Enron that are saying we have a problem is the people hired from the Powers report and myself. REP. STUPAK: So, despite all these restatement of accounting and restatement of financial statements, again, the Powers Report and you -- MS. WATKINS: Well, the Raptor transactions have not been restated yet. REP. STUPAK: So, what concerns would you still have then about the transparency or the accuracy of Enron\'s financial statements, beside the Raptor hasn\'t been fully restated? MS. WATKINS: Well, the Raptor transactions need to be fully restated, and -- REP. STUPAK: Anything else? MS. WATKINS: Well, if the -- there was another memo written by an employee from Enron Energy Services -- it was disclosed in the press. I think it outlined how Enron solved its EES mark-to-market valuation issues that I raised at the first part of my anonymous letter, and that needs to be looked at. That\'s segment reporting. I\'m sure they actually bore the loss in the wholesale group, but that segment reporting was important to Enron in 2001. REP. STUPAK: Well, it seems like the October 16th revaluation, if you will, was a result of your efforts. And it\'s our understanding between October 16th and November 8th there, you continued to push Ken Lay and others to do further restatements. So, maybe after your testimony today we can expect some more restatements from Enron, or some coming clean on Raptor or something like that -- hopefully, because we really want to get to the bottom of this. And what are all the problems here? Let\'s get it on the table. They\'re in the bankruptcy situation and we want to get this thing moved on. It brings me to my next question. In the minutes, and throughout some testimony and some of the flow charts we\'ve seen throughout here, there\'s mention of Enron Europe, the Southern Cone, which would be South America, Brazil, Australia, Japan. If we\'re seeing all these problems here in this country related to Enron, do you know of any problems that others are seeing overseas? What\'s happened over there in Australia? In Brazil, they were particularly concerned about the devaluation of their currency there and how it would affect Enron. So, the Enron collapse, how has it affected things overseas, if you know? MS. WATKINS: I\'m not -- I was in Enron international, but most of the international assets are hard assets. They\'re accrual-based assets. They\'re fairly tradition. In a country like Brazil that has devaluation concerns, it might mean that we don\'t achieve the U.S. dollar cash price that we paid, but I don\'t know of anything that would indicate any kind of financial statement manipulation related to those assets. REP. STUPAK: In -- I\'m looking at your memo. It\'s dated October 30th, 2001, 4:45. I\'m on the second page. It looks like it\'s tab number 21. And I\'m looking on the bottom of page two. It says ""Note."" Are you with me? MS. WATKINS: Yes. REP. STUPAK: Okay. It says ""Note. After restatement, the good news is that our core trading business is solid with strong numbers to report. The bad news, EBS was losing big money in 2000. The big losses didn\'t start until 2001 and EES did not start making a profit in 2000. So how would -- was the shareholders ever made aware of any of this? MS. WATKINS: My concern when I was making this point was that Enron Broadband and Enron Energy Services were our growth vehicles. They were supposedly one of the reasons why we were enjoying a high PE multiple. And we did finally report to investor that EBS was losing money, large amounts of money in 2001. But, the Raptor hedge on Evichi (sp) made EBS look like it had only lost 50 or 60 million in 2000 when actually it was more like 250 million. And, it was very important to Enron that we announce that Enron Energy Services was profitable in 2000. Without the new power hedges, EES was not profitable in 2000. This would have significantly impacted our PE (multiple ?) and our stock price in the year 2000. REP. STUPAK: So, it\'s fair to say, if you started losing money in 2000 and it really wasn\'t reported until 2001, so you probably have -- you have at least 12 months, so basically the shareholders weren\'t told the truth here of what was going on with this situation. Is that are fair statement? MS. WATKINS: That\'s a fair statement. REP. STUPAK: Okay. With that, Mr. Chairman, I have nothing further. Thank you. And thank you again. REP. TAUZIN: I thank you very much, Mr. Stupak. As we conclude, I note, Ms. Watkins, that on that same memo you make the point that Lay should meet with top SEC officials and that Ken Lay and Enron needed to support one of the SEC\'s long-term objectives requiring that the big five accounting firms rotate off their large clients on a regular basis as short as three years. Do you stand by that recommendation? MS. WATKINS: Yes, I do. I mean, as an investor in the U.S. stock market, I would feel a lot more comfortable knowing the public companies had to rotate their accounting firms every three years. REP. TAUZIN: It\'s a recommendation we received from a number of sources as we go forward. Let me make several observations -- first of all, that you sort of stumbled onto Raptors. You\'re not here saying that\'s all that may have been wrong. There may be other things in other transactions that you are not aware of that may need some inquiry, is that correct? MS. WATKINS: Yes sir. REP. TAUZIN: Secondly, that, as I said at the beginning of this hearing, we\'re going to try to move as rapidly as we can from this inquiry into an actual examination of solutions. And the committees are beginning to do that, and one of them met today, one of them met yesterday. And Mr. Greenwood and Mr. Stearns, in fact, have been asked by the committee to actually begin putting a set of recommendations together for the committee to look at. And your thoughts, as you have been asked before by some members in regards to your observations and recommended changes we might make are certainly welcome, and we would appreciate it. Ms. Watkins, your testimony stands for itself. It doesn\'t need a whole lot of elaboration by me or editorial comment, but I do want to make one. And that is that your testimony, your activities in regard to Enron actually call upon, I think, all of us to examine the notion of corporate loyalty. There is some, I assume who believe corporate loyalty is protecting the corporation against all harm, even when it\'s doing something wrong. You demonstrated for us a different definition of corporate loyalty, a different definition of fiduciary responsibility to a corporation. That includes responsibility to its shareholders and investors, and I want to compliment you for that. There are mothers and fathers listening to these hearings and who have heard your testimony and now have an experience, I think, upon which to hopefully teach their sons and daughters who are going to work for American corporations about the notion of corporate loyalty that you bring to the table this morning -- the notion that corporate loyalty means owning up to mistakes for the sake of the proper relationship to investors and consumers, and confronting them directly and reporting them and dealing with them forthrightly. Would that the last clear chance you gave the leadership of Enron been accepted and taken, apparently that didn\'t happen, but you at least stood for that proposition, and again I commend you for that. I hope that sons and daughters of American citizens follow your example, frankly, and adopt your concept of corporate loyalty as a mantra. As I said, we are learning from this hearings. I think corporate America is learning from these hearings. And I truly believe, as Mr. Greenwood does, that when we complete them -- and our work is not yet finished -- but when we complete them, we will, together -- Democrats and Republicans on this committee -- be able to propose a set of reforms, together with the reforms that I know that corporate America itself is talking about instituting, and agencies of our government are talking about instituting, that is going to build better, clearer, more responsible lines of communication and information and disclosure and investor confidence in this country. If that\'s a result of this mess, then perhaps our country will be much better for it in the end, and you will have contributed mightily to that process. For that I thank you. And unless there is any other business to come before the committee, the chair announces that the record will stay open for 30 days. Ms. Watkins, your testimony was under oath, of course, and if you and your attorney will carefully review it, and if there are any additional comments or clarifications or additions you want to make for the record, the record is open for 30 days. We may have additional questions we\'d like to submit to you in writing to which you might respond, we\'ll be in touch with you in that regard. Again, thank you for your extraordinary cooperation and for your contributions. The hearing stands adjourned.', 'REP. GREENWOOD: (Sounds gavel.) Good morning. This hearing of the Oversight and Investigations Subcommittee of the Energy and Commerce Committee will come to order. And the chair recognizes himself for an opening statement. ""I wish we could get caught. We are such a crooked company."" Of all the words in the now famous memo our witness sent to Kenneth Lay in August of last year, these might be the most chilling. According to this morning\' witness, the person who uttered those words was a management level of Enron, a team player, a person who probably stood to lose a great deal in any financial collapse at Enron. What is the truth behind Enron\'s precipitous collapse? This morning we have before us as our sole witness Ms. Sherron Watkins, Enron\'s vice president of corporate development. Ms. Watkins has become known as the lone voice who sought to warn Enron chairman and CEO Ken Lay that Enron was in danger of imploding, quote, ""in a wave of accounting scandals."" Subsequent events have proved the truth of that unvarnished assessment. What we now understand from evidence this committee has gathered in its investigation, and the materials contained in the Powers Report, and from testimony of senior Enron officials at last week\'s hearing, that these so-called aggressive accounting practices were used to hide an even larger business failure. Last week we took testimony from two senior Enron officials, Jordan Mintz; and then treasurer, now Enron president and chief operating officer, Jeffrey McMahon. They too anguished that something was terribly wrong at Enron, but were unable to determine the full extent of the problems or the dangers ahead. Unlike them, our witness this morning was privy to substantially more evidence of the accounting practices used to hide various related party transactions between Enron and what are known as the Raptor entities -- special purpose entities owned by LJM2, the limited partnership set up and run by Enron and its former chief financial officer, Andrew Fastow. She will testify today that in her opinion these transactions were outright manipulations of Enron\'s income statements, booking fictitious income, and hiding actual losses. Ms. Watkins took her concerns right to the top. She wrote a memo to Mr. Lay on August 15th that set forth in stark terms the seriousness of Enron\'s situation and the dire consequences that would inevitably result if corrective action were not taken -- and soon. We now know that Ms. Watkins also met with Mr. Lay not just once, as had been previously disclosed, but on two additional times in late October of last year, to further share her concerns and to urge that Enron restate its income statements for the past two years, due to the deceptive transactions with the Raptor\'s special purpose entities. Yet, until the Powers Report came out two weeks ago affirming her analysis of the Raptors, no one at Enron or Andersen ever sought to address these concerns. Indeed, the actions taken by Enron in October and November of last year to revise its earnings and shareholder equity numbers still fail to address many of the concerns raised by Ms. Watkins, and confirmed by the Powers Report. Ms. Watkins also will describe today her meetings and conversations with others throughout Enron\'s corporate hierarchy, as well as with outside advisors. This included Mr. McMahon, associate general counsel Rex Rogers, vice president for human resources Cindy Olson, James Hecker (ph) -- an Enron audit partner -- and Vinson and Elkins managing partner Joe Dilg. Her initial meeting with Mr. Lay in August prompted an investigation by Vinson and Elkins, assisted by Andersen -- the very two parties Ms. Watkins urged Mr. Lay and others not to include in the review because of clear conflicts of interests. Not surprisingly, the report that Vinson and Elkins issued on October 15th was so flawed that Ms. Watkins seriously considered leaving the company. Instead she persisted in her attempts to convince Mr. Lay of the enormity of the challenge facing Enron, and the failure of outside experts to clearly state the facts. It wasn\'t until October 31st that Ms. Watkins learned that a special committee of the board of directors would examine Enron\'s questionable business practices. This investigation has since become known as the Powers inquiry. Ms. Watkins\' appearance and testimony before us today will be the first time anyone has had the opportunity to question her publicly about her own actions, and how individuals at the highest level in the company responded to her warnings. Let me point out that Ms. Watkins is not a whistle-blower in the conventional sense. She was and is a loyal company employee who sought valiantly, and sadly in vain, to get the people in charge to face the facts and make the hard choices needed to save the company. Ms. Watkins indeed is still an Enron employee, and because of this fact has requested a subpoena compelling her testimony today. I want to point out, however, that she has been responsive to and very cooperative with our investigators, and I look forward to her sharing with the subcommittee and the American public in her own words how it came to be that at the end a once faithful employee concluded that her company was cooking the books. Ms. Watkins, thank you for your help. We welcome your testimony. The chair recognizes the gentleman from Florida, Mr. Deutsch, for his opening statement. REP. PETER DEUTSCH (D-FL): Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and thank you, Ms. Watkins, for being here. You know, this is obviously our continuation of trying to understand what happened at Enron, and really looking at it and looking at the future. And I really want to take a couple of second just thanking the chairmen of the subcommittee and the full committee, but also the staff. I think our staff has really done an incredible job over the last about eight weeks or so. And this subcommittee has a long history in the Congress of looking at issues of really cases of failures, of corruption. And Chairman Dingell who led this subcommittee for so many years created almost a historic reputation for this subcommittee, and I believe that this hearing and this process that we are doing is part of that. I have tried to put in perspective what we are doing and where we hope to lead. And it\'s not just an investigation for an investigation\'s sake. But I think all of us at this point -- we know a lot more than we knew a week ago, a lot more than two weeks ago, that the issues I think are much broader than just Enron. The issues really our capital systems and the transparency in the accounting system. And I think what we all understand is that our economy, which is the strongest economy in the history of the world, one of the reasons that we have that economy is transparency in the capital markets and the public accounting system. And I don\'t think there\'s a question that totally abysmally failed in the case of Enron. I mean, I think it\'s factually accurate that it filed; that trying to understand Enron from its public documents I think was close to impossible. Those documents did not fairly represent the actual state of the company. And, you know, the secretary of the Treasury when Enron initially filed for bankruptcy said that, Well, this is not a big deal -- companies go bankrupt, they don\'t go bankrupt -- they\'re successful, they\'re not. I take great exception to that. There have been several major companies in America that have gone bankrupt since Enron -- Kmart has gone bankrupt, Global Crossing has gone bankrupt. But I mean there is a fundamental difference. The public markets knew what was going on in those companies -- it was transparent. It was reflected in equity value. People could understand what was going on. In the case of Enron, that was not the case. The seventh largest company in America vaporized in literally a matter of weeks, and the house of cards fell. And as we are looking at transaction after transaction after transaction, and again the number at this point, our understanding is there were 4,000 of these partnerships, and the Raptors were probably the largest, but just a several -- that the method seemed to be continuously used again and again. I guess the concern we have -- and I have -- but I think all my colleagues share is, number one: You know, How do we protect our capital markets from, number one, this never happening again, because I think that\'s clearly our goal, that when people try to understand public companies they can understand -- that\'s the whole point. But, number two, who else is doing this? And obviously I don\'t think you\'re going to be able to tell us that today. But I think that is clearly a critical component that you, as someone who was watching what was going on, understood what was going on. And if there are other companies out there that are out there doing this, obviously people in those companies know it as well. And I guess one of the things that hopefully will happen is that it will immediately be reflected in statements and their filings to the SEC. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. REP. GREENWOOD: The chair thanks the gentleman and recognizes the chairman of the full committee, the gentleman from Louisiana, Mr. Tauzin, for an opening statement. REP. BILLY TAUZIN (R-LA): Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Let me first thank you, Mr. Chairman, and the incredible work of the Democratic and Republican joint investigatory staff. You have done I think our country a great service, and you continue to do so with these hearings, and I deeply appreciate -- I know I speak for all the members -- your personal commitment to this task. Let me first observe that as a result of these hearings and the incredible new information that our witness will provide us with today, I think America is learning what went wrong at Enron. More importantly, corporate execs across America are reassessing -- corporate management and board members across America are beginning to ask hard questions and to become significantly more involved and concerned in the operations of their companies. The SEC has announced its planned reforms. FASB has announced planned reforms. This committee and the committee that we assigned the job of jurisdiction over FASB and the accounting standards in America, chaired by Cliff Stearns of Florida, is beginning the process of recommending legislation to our full committee. Yesterday the subcommittee on Energy of our committee examined the aspects of the Enron collapse on the energy markets of America, and we are investigating allegations of potential damage done. Generally the news is good -- the energy markets held up -- electricity flowed, gas flowed. Somehow companies worked around the financial collapse of Enron and continued to deliver energy at reasonable prices, in fact lower prices, to the American public during this crisis. And today we will hear from an officer of the Enron Corporation who really knew and who really understood who the culprits were within her own company, and who did her best to make sure that those in control of her company, if they had been kept in the dark, were no longer in the dark, and understood the problems the company faced. There is a doctrine in law called the last clear chance. It\'s a doctrine that says that even if you are totally in the right on the highway, if you had the last clear chance to avoid the accident you can still be responsible for what happened. Our witness today will talk about how she attempted to give the leadership at Enron a last clear chance -- not just to do what was right in correcting its filings with the American public and the investors in this company, but to do what was right in getting rid of culprits, in assigning responsibility, in accepting responsibility, and in correcting the problems, in the hope that there was still a chance to save the corporation from the bankruptcy it now faces. We will learn whether the company took that last clear chance. I don\'t think there\'s anything more prophetic in the document we have now received from our witness describing her evaluation of the culprits, of what happened, who was responsible for it, and what had to be done if the company was going to have a chance to be saved. In the last paragraphs of that memo which our witness handed Mr. Ken Lay on October 30th, I quote: ""My conclusions if Ken Lay takes these steps. The bad news: this is horrific. Plaintiff attorneys will be celebrating. The trouble facing the company will be obvious to all. The good news: while speculations will slow down, if not cease, nobody wants Ken Lay\'s head. He is very well respected in business and the community."" And then she identifies the culprits. The culprits are Skilling, Fastow, Glisson, Causey as well as Arthur Andersen and V&E. In the final paragraph we find, ""My conclusions if we don\'t come clean and restate, all these bad things will happen to us anyway -- it\'s just that Ken Lay will be more implicated in this than is deserved, and he won\'t get the chance, I might add, the last clear chance, to restore the company to its former stature."" What we are learning, and what will be confirmed today, I believe, by this witness, is that we have witnessed an incredible -- an incredible collection of not only miscreants and potential criminal behavior, but a series of abuses of accounting standards and practices, a series of abuses of the American public investing -- the investing public in and its confidence in this company, and its knowledge about its income and it debt, abuse that led to a horrible loss to its employees, not only of their jobs but of their pensions, and abuses that have rocked Wall Street and the investment communities and the corporate boards of America. If there is any good news in all this, it\'s that we\'re finding out what went wrong. We\'re really getting to the bottom of it, and we\'re learning how we might turn the corner and begin to make improvements in our laws and our rules to help make sure that no other company experiences this again. But there is other good news, and I say this with deep appreciation, Ms. Watkins, it\'s the knowledge that there are people like you in this world who are willing to try to make it right, who understand their fiduciary responsibility to their company, and are willing to go out on the limb as you did to make sure that people who could make a difference, who could change things, who could make it right, and who could save that company, did have at least a last great chance to do it. And there\'s one other good news. And I have a perspective that I think more and more members are beginning at least to share. There may be other problems in other companies in America -- this is incredibly an aberration. I have never in all of the years of watching companies succeed and fail and bankruptcies -- and there have been some might big bankruptcies in this country -- seen anything like this. When we are through examining it and responding to it, I think the American public will be well-served by the process of learning from this experience and the changes we are going to make. And the witness who comes before us will deserve again the appreciation of the American public for doing what she did, and for standing out the way she has. I deeply appreciate you being here, Ms. Watkins. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. REP. GREENWOOD: The chair thanks the gentleman. And before recognizing the ranking member of the full committee, would announce that we have apparently two votes before us now. So, after Mr. Dingell\'s opening remarks, we will recess and make these two votes and come back. REP. JOHN DINGELL (D-MI): I\'m willing to do it whichever way you like, Mr. Chairman -- go no, or go later. REP. GREENWOOD: Well, I would welcome the gentleman\'s opening statement now -- REP. DINGELL: Very well. REP. GREENWOOD: -- and the other members are free to go. REP. DINGELL: Mr. Chairman, thank you for holding this hearing. And I commend you and the committee for continuing the investigation into the actions that caused Enron, once the seventh largest company in the country, to become the largest bankruptcy in the history of the country. Each hearing that we have held, and I expect we will be holding more, reveals more of the internal corruption that destroyed Enron, as corruption swept in Enron\'s top management as well as its in-house and outside accountants and lawyers, all of whom reviewed and approved the transactions that we discussed today. All of them apparently knew that Enron was pledging its stock to guarantee its own hedges with an alleged outside party. This is clearly a violation of all accounting procedures and principles, and apparently one that the Houston office of Arthur Andersen approved over the opposition of its Chicago office. It led directly to a $1.1 billion reduction in Enron\'s equity, and a $700,000 reduction in earnings. These same people knew that a partnership run by Enron\'s chief financial officer, who was benefitting greatly from these transaction. All of them, and an unquestioning board of directors did nothing. I want to thank Ms. Watkins for the heroic efforts she made to help Enron avoid this, in her own words, ""implosion and a wave of accounting scandals."" Ms. Watkins took the actions that should have been taken months before by many others both inside and outside of Enron with fiduciary duties to the company and to its shareholders. I think we should applaud her. It is never easy to be a whistleblower, particularly in a company where the mentality did not encourage negative news and negative views. Bearers of bad news are often punished. Today we are going to concentrate on the Raptor transactions, which have been described by the report of the special committee as extremely complex Raptor (?) structured finance vehicles designed to allow Enron to avoid reflecting losses in the value of some merchant investments on its income statement. We cannot fully understand the structure of the vehicles, but we know they are breathtaking in scope, and breathtaking -- (inaudible) -- and in the impact they had. These four vehicles resulted in a write-down of equity, the restatement of earnings, and a credit reduction that sank Enron. Although the Raptors were supposed to take the risk of losses in merchant investments, they actually were guaranteed by Enron stock and used the appreciation in Enron stock value to increase earnings. This is a violation of all basic accounting principles. The accounting shenanigans that permitted such returns were instigated and/or approved by Andrew Fastow, Enron\'s chief financial officer, Richard Causey, Enron\'s chief accounting officer, Rick Buy, Enron\'s chief risk management officer, Arthur Andersen and by Vinson & Elkins, Enron\'s outside counsel. The Raptors also benefitted greatly LJM-II, a special purpose entity run by Mr. Fastow. Although they were supposed to hedge potential losses in some of Enron\'s merchant investments, they actually repaid LJM-II\'s owner investment some generous returns with Enron taking the total risk. As described in an LJM-II presentation to its partners in October of 2000, Raptor-3, for example, paid out $41 million on a $30 million investment in just eight days. This is an amazing 2,503 percent annual return for those investors. I think it\'s important to note for the record, Mr. Chairman, that Mr. Fastow, Mr. Causey, Mr. Buy, and Arthur Andersen have all been removed from their positions -- perhaps too late, but they have anyway. But Enron has supported Vinson & Elkins, which approved every single one of these deals for Enron, and then -- (inaudible) -- Ms. Watkins\' allegations in a report, finding not a single transaction with LJM was contrary to Enron\'s best interests to this day. The law firm\'s written report was issued just one day before Enron announced its equity write-down and earnings and reductions based on the very Raptor transactions that Mr. Watkins brought to Kenneth Lay\'s attention. I think it would be quite appropriate to devote a hearing to the role Enron\'s legal counsel played in this fiasco that took $70 billion from the pockets of unsuspecting shareholders and employees. And I note that their role in this does not credit to the profession of which I take pride in being a part. But today I look forward to hearing from an extraordinary, courageous woman, who has been a bright spot in an otherwise sorry and outrageous saga. Ms. Watkins, we thank you. Mr. Chairman, I thank you. REP. GREENWOOD: The chair thanks the gentlemen, and the committee will recess for approximately 20 minutes. (Recess.) REP. GREENWOOD: The committee will come to order. And the chair recognizes the gentleman from Florida, Mr. Stearns, for an opening statement. REP. CLIFF STEARNS (R-FL): Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And Ms. Watkins, obviously, like other members, I\'d like to take the opportunity to welcome you to our committee and pleased that you\'re willing to testify. Your status is perhaps not, as the press might outline, that you\'re a whistleblower. You\'re not the traditional whistleblower in the sense that you\'re still working for the company. And the way you did it was commendable in the sense that you went to different people and talked to them and you asked for a transfer to another part of the company. But in sort of a semantic way, you\'re not a whistleblower in the traditional sense. I\'m not sure if we have a word which describes when you complain and you stay within the company and work as you did, but it, I think, was very effective and helpful for us. I believe that employees such as yourself, in no small measure, contribute to the integrity of our commercial system by insisting that all participants play by the rules. And I think all Americans thank you for what you did. Secondly, I want to explore a number of substantive issues which you raise in your August 15th, 2001 memo to Mr. Lay that touched upon the efficacy of our financial accounting standards. As part of the full committee\'s Enron investigation, Chairman Tauzin has asked my subcommittee, which is Commerce, Trade & Consumer Protection, to examine our accounting standards in light of the Enron collapse. As a matter of fact, my subcommittee just concluded a hearing which examined the adequacy and responsiveness of existing accounting standards. I believe, as it seems, you may believe also, when you wrote the memo to Mr. Lay, that there is ample evidence that Enron, at a minimum, confused, obfuscated its true financial health from the investing public by using or possibly misusing financial accounting standards. I now think there is enough evidence to suggest that Enron did not use special-purpose entities such as Raptor as generally accepted accounting principles would authorize it, but they used it to hide poor-performing merchant investments so that Enron would not have to show the declining values that existed on their income statement. Moreover, it appears that Enron reported the transfer of assets to SPEs as a sale and recognized them as such in its income statement, while it held the third-party investors in the SPE harmless against the risk associated with those assets by pledging its stock as collateral. I believe this is what you alluded to in your memo when you wrote, and I\'m quoting, quote, ""If adequately explained, the investor would know that the entities described in our related-party footnote"" -- and I assume you meant footnote number 16 of Enron\'s 2000 annual report -- ""are thinly-capitalized. The equity-holders have no skin in the game, and all the value in the entities come from underlying values of the derivative."" Unfortunately, in this case, there was a big loss in Enron stock (and NP?). So during the question-and-answer period, I hope we can further explore that. Again, thank you very much for testifying. REP. GREENWOOD: The chair thanks the gentleman and would urge each of the members, if they could, to keep their opening remarks to as brief as possible so we can move forward with the witness, in view of the fact that we have votes and members will be leaving. The chair recognizes the gentleman, Mr. Stupak, for an opening statement. REP. BART STUPAK (D-MI): Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I want to thank you, Ms. Watkins, for coming here today. Many of my colleagues and I truly appreciate your brave actions in informing Mr. Lay about the shady accounting that was going on in Enron. It\'s a shame that he and others on the board and in leadership positions at Enron did not see these problems much earlier. Even now, there\'s a denial and a lack of acceptability of responsibility by Enron officials in all the hearings we\'ve had thus far to date. It\'s also a shame that even after you provided Mr. Lay with a road map of what was going on in Enron, as the Powers report put it, they decided to hire inside counsel to do the investigation into the allegations. That counsel, Vinson & Elkins, was the very law firm that was responsible for providing advice on many of the questionable transactions. It was no surprise that Vinson & Elkins, in summarizing their findings, stated that Ms. Watkins\' concerns were thoroughly investigated but, quoting now, ""found not to raise new or undisclosed information,"" end of quote. Mr. Chairman, we know that once a truly independent firm, one from outside the Enron family, was allowed to review the transactions, they came to a very different conclusion. Ms. Watkins, you mentioned in your interview with committee staff that when you met with Mr. Lay to discuss your memo, you felt like the child who tells the emperor that he has no clothes. (Inaudible) -- the emperor\'s new clothes. And while you\'re to be commended for coming forward in August of 2001, there was another emperor, Jeffrey Skilling, who was running Enron prior to your August 15th letter. And I have a feeling he knew he had no clothes, and that is why or that is what prompted his resignation. I\'d like to take just a moment to read you, if I may, the final page of Hans Christian Andersen\'s story. I don\'t believe he\'s any relation to Arthur Andersen. (Laughter.) But the last page of the story goes like this. It says, ""The emperor shivered, for it seemed they were right. But what could he do? After all, he was the emperor, and people expected him to be dignified. \'I must continue to end the procession,\' he thought, so the empire"" -- the emperor, excuse me -- ""the emperor stood up, just as tall, and his servants went on carrying the train that wasn\'t there."" Mr. Chairman, reading this, I can\'t help but think of our last hearing last week with Mr. Skilling and his own parade and his servants, Mr. Winokur and Jaedicke, following behind him, carrying his non-existent robe. I know we\'re anxious to hear Ms. Watkins\' testimony, so I\'m going to take your advice and look forward to answering the questions that will be put to you today. So, Mr. Chairman, with that, I\'ll yield back my time. REP. GREENWOOD: The chair thanks the gentleman and thanks him for not showing the picture of the unclothed emperor. (Laughter.) The chair recognizes the gentleman from North Carolina, Mr. Burr, for an opening statement. REP. RICHARD BURR (R-NC): I thank the chairman. Mr. Chairman, we have before us today a witness who I believe can provide the most insight and helpful testimony we have yet to hear in piecing together this affair. With her background as a CPA and a former employee of Andersen, many have described Sherron Watkins as being unique in her ability to bring light on this charade. I\'d add one more uniqueness about Ms. Watkins that was lacking in all the other individuals who have chosen to come before this committee to stop the bleeding at Enron -- a moral compass. In her now famous August memo, she brought to light what she saw as accounting improprieties, most noticeably in the Raptor transactions. Today she will share with us her observations and concerns that she raised with Enron executives, most noticeably Ken Lay, concerns that fell on deaf ears at the top of the company, while simultaneously this one-time giant fell to its knees. Mr. Chairman, I could detail what others have done. I think what best details the situation at Enron were the list of songs by the Texas native who just passed away, Waylon Jennings. One song might be, ""I Ain\'t Livin\' Long Like This."" ""Wanted: The Outlaws."" ""Mama, Don\'t Let Your Babies Grow Up To Be Cowboys,"" or just ""Some Good Old Boys."" And Andersen could best be described as ""Are You Sure Hank Done It That Way?"" However, Waylon\'s ballad, ""A Good-Hearted Woman,"" could better describe the witness we have before us today. In all seriousness, thank you, Sherron, for appearing before us. You\'re doing this committee and your fellow Enron employees a great service. In the New Testament, when Peter stepped out of the boat and walked on water, the miracle wasn\'t the fact that he walked on water. No, the miracle was that he chose to put his faith in God and step out of the boat, a boat which was his protection but was bound to sink in troubled water. Thank you for choosing to step out of the boat today. I yield back. REP. GREENWOOD: The chair thanks the gentleman and recognizes himself for 10 minutes for questions. Ms. Watkins, when you and I -- oh, I\'m sorry. I\'m sorry. It\'s a good thing we have staff here. Ms. Watkins, you\'re aware that this committee is holding an investigative hearing. And when holding an investigative hearing, it is our practice to take testimony under oath. Do you have any objections to taking your testimony under -- giving your testimony under oath today? MS. WATKINS: No, I don\'t. REP. GREENWOOD: Okay. Do you -- the chair advises you that under the rules of this committee and the rules of the House, you are entitled to be advised by counsel. Do you choose to be advised by counsel today? MS. WATKINS: Yes, I do. REP. GREENWOOD: And would you identify your counsel for me? MS. WATKINS: Mr. Philip Hilder. REP. GREENWOOD: Okay. Sir, would you spell your last name? MR. HILDER: Hilder, sir -- H-I-L-D-E-R. REP. GREENWOOD: Thank you. In that case, if you would please rise and raise your right hand, I\'ll give you the oath. Do you swear that the testimony you are about to give is the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth? MS. WATKINS: I do. REP. GREENWOOD: Okay. Be seated. You are under oath, and you are recognized for your opening remarks. You\'ll probably want to pull that microphone over to you, and it\'s fairly directional. MS. WATKINS: Okay. Good morning, Mr. Chairman, members of the subcommittee. I\'m Sherron Watkins. And thank you for the opportunity to address the subcommittee this morning. REP. GREENWOOD: Pull it up a little closer and speak right into it. There you go. MS. WATKINS: I\'m currently employed at Enron Corporation as a vice president. By way of background, I hold a master\'s degree in professional accounting from the University of Texas at Austin, and I have been a certified public accountant since 1983. I began my career in 1982 at Arthur Andersen as an auditor. I spent eight years at Andersen in both the Houston and New York offices. I joined New York-based MG Trade Finance in 1990 to manage their portfolio of commodity-backed finance assets. I held that position until October of 1993. In October of 1993, I was hired by Mr. Andrew Fastow and moved back to Houston to manage Enron\'s newly-formed partnership with CALPERS, the California Public Employee Retirement System. The partnership was the Joint Energy Development Investments Limited Partnership, or JEDI. I held the JEDI management portfolio position until the end of 1996. From 1997 until early 2000, I worked for Enron International, primarily in the Mergers & Acquisitions Group, which is also known as the Corporate Development Group. In early 2000, I transferred to Enron Broad-Band Services. I worked there until June of 2000 in a variety of roles. In mid to late June of 2001, I went to work directly for Mr. Fastow, assisting in the corporate development work that had been put under his supervision after Cliff Baxter resigned in May of 2001. I worked for Mr. Fastow in this new role into late August 2001. I have since been reassigned into the Human Resources Group, with a variety of assignments. While working for Mr. Fastow in 2001, I was charged with reviewing all assets that Enron considered for sale and determining the likely economic impact of sale. As part of the sale analysis, I reviewed the estimated book values and market values of each asset. A number of assets were hedged with an entity called Raptor. Any asset that was hedged should, for the most part, have a locked-in sales value for Enron, meaning that despite current market prices, Enron should realize the hedged price of the Raptor. It was my understanding that the Raptor special-purpose entities were owned by LJM, a partnership run by Mr. Fastow. In completing my work, certain Enron business units provided me with analyses that showed certain of the hedged losses that had been incurred by Raptor were actually coming back to Enron. The general explanation was that the Enron -- (inaudible) -- the Raptor hedge had declined in value such that Raptor would have a shortfall and would be unable to fully cover the hedge price that it owed Enron. I was highly alarmed by the information I was receiving. My understanding as an accountant is that a company could never use its own stock to generate a gain or avoid a loss on its income statement. I continued to ask questions and seek answers, primarily from former co-workers in the Global Finance Group or in the business units that had hedged assets with Raptor. I never heard reassuring explanations. I was not comfortable confronting either Mr. Skilling or Mr. Fastow with my concerns. To do so, I believe, would have been a job- terminating move. On August 14th, 2001, I was informed of Mr. Skilling\'s sudden resignation, and felt compelled to inform Mr. Lay of the accounting problems that faced Enron. I sent Mr. Lay an anonymous letter on August 14th, 2001, in response to a request for questions for an upcoming all-employee meeting to be held August 16th, to address Mr. Skilling\'s departure. At the all-employee meeting, Mr. Lay commented that our visions and values had slipped, and that if any employee was troubled by anything at Enron, please bring those concerns to him or any number of the top management, including Cindy Olson, Steve Kane and others. On August 16th I met with Ms. Olson to show her a copy of the letter and discuss it with her. She encouraged me to meet with Mr. Lay personally. Since Mr. Lay was traveling through the rest of the week, she said the meeting would probably take place the week of August 20th. I was concerned that Mr. Lay was planning to fill the Office of the Chair over the weekend, and that he might choose Mr. Fastow or Rick Causey, the chief accounting officer. To voice my concerns, I met with Rex Rogers, Enron\'s associate general counsel on Friday, August 17th, 2001. I provided Mr. Rogers with a version of the anonymous letter, as well as two additional memos, all of which are part of the seven pages that this committee discovered in mid June 2002 -- I mean, January 2002. On Monday, August 20th, 2001, Mr. Lay\'s assistant scheduled a meeting for me to meet with Mr. Lay that following Wednesday, August 22nd, 2001. I subsequently held discussions with a former mentor at Andersen, James Hecker (sp), and a long-time friend and co-worker, Jeffrey McMahon, to vet my concerns before my meeting with Mr. Lay. I met with Mr. Lay on the afternoon of Wednesday, August 22nd, 2001. The meeting lasted just over one half hour. I provided him with five memos I had drafted to help explain the problems facing the company. These five memos constitute the seven pages this committee discovered and subsequently disclosed on January 14th, 2002. Additionally, I provided Mr. Lay an analysis of the Raptor entity economics and a presentation prepared by Enron\'s risk assessment and control group. I primarily used the memo titled ""Summary of Raptor Oddities"" as talking points with Mr. Lay. My main point to Mr. Lay was that by this time Raptor owed Enron in excess of $700 million under certain hedging agreements. My understanding was that the Raptor entities basically had no other business aside from these hedges; therefore, they had collectively lost over $700 million. I urged Mr. Lay to find out who lost that money. If he discovered that this loss would be borne by Enron shareholders, via an issuance of stock in the future, then I thought we had a very large problem on our hands. I gave Mr. Lay my opinion that it is never appropriate for a company to use its stock to affect its income statement. At the conclusion of the meeting, Mr. Lay assured me that he would look into my concerns. I also requested a transfer, as I was uncomfortable remaining as a direct report to Mr. Fastow. I intend to fully cooperate with the subcommittee, and I now welcome the opportunity to answer any questions the members may have at this time. REP. GREENWOOD: Thank you very much for your testimony, Ms. Watkins. And we all thank you again for being here. The chair recognizes himself for 10 minutes for inquiry. Ms. Watkins, when we spoke yesterday you described that in your earlier days working for Mr. Fastow the special purpose entities were basically legitimate; they seemed to be garden variety securitized entities that were designed to do legitimate -- serve legitimate financial purposes, with which you had no qualms. And as you described -- and I think Condor was one of those early SPEs that fit that category. As you described your time with the company, it seemed to me that it was like the story of the frog and the pot on the stove: that gradually, largely directed by Mr. Fastow, I understand, the rules of the game began to change, and the legitimacy of these entities and partnerships began to be stretched, till finally we end up with something like the Raptors, which seem to serve no legitimate -- and perhaps not even a legal -- purpose. And it seemed to me that the difficulty was that the corporate culture was slowly acclimated to this transition from what was quite legitimate to what was clearly not legitimate. Let me ask you this specific question: Is it your opinion that the Raptor transactions then were nothing more than sheer income statement manipulation? And if you do think that, why do you say so? MS. WATKINS: That is my opinion, and it is my opinion because true economic risk was not passed to a third party. Raptor owed Enron in excess of $700 million, and there was not an outside third party that bore that loss. It was going to be borne by Enron shareholders by an issuance of stock in the future. REP. GREENWOOD: Explain how that affected the income statements. MS. WATKINS: Well, the -- Raptor was hedging with -- REP. GREENWOOD: Again, if you would pull the microphone a little closer -- the silver one is the one that actually broadcasts into the room here. MS. WATKINS: The Raptor hedges were locking in supposedly sales value that Enron had on equity investments that it had made. The investments that were probably the more volatile was a tech investment in Avichi (ph) and the new power company, a start-up that Enron had done. Those investments were hedged with Raptor. They had dropped significantly in value. And in the related-party footnote in 2000, it mentions that Enron had recognized $500 million of revenue from the special entities, offsetting a corresponding write-down in the equity investment portfolio of Enron. I think that tended to make readers think that it was a $500 million gain, offset by a $500 million loss; therefore zero impact on the income statement. However, without the Raptor transactions Enron would have had a $500 million loss, not covered by any gains, running through the 2000 income statement. REP. GREENWOOD: As you came to understand this, prior to your meeting, your first meeting with Mr. Lay, did you discuss these concerns with other employees at Enron? MS. WATKINS: As I was doing my work and looking at these Raptor -- these assets hedged by Raptor, my concern was that it seemed to be just common knowledge that the Raptor losses were backstopped by Enron stock. And an analysis was always looked at -- what\'s the value of Enron stock compared to the money Raptor owes us? And I was shocked that people could explain this to me with no concern in their voice, like there was some magic structure that Enron and Andersen had come up with to make this work. REP. GREENWOOD: And did it seem to be -- did you get the impression, or was it said to you others that they thought that this was perfectly legitimate, or that it was shaky but everyone is going along with the deal? MS. WATKINS: There were people like Mr. McMahon and others that had expressed concerns about LJM and the transactions Enron was doing with LJM. But for the most part people seemed to think there was some accounting rule that was allowing this to be acceptable. It was very common knowledge. It wasn\'t hidden. REP. GREENWOOD: Did you watch Mr. Skilling\'s testimony before this subcommittee last week? MS. WATKINS: Yes, I did. REP. GREENWOOD: Would you care to comment on how you reacted as you heard Mr. Skilling describe his awareness or lack of awareness or understanding of these transactions? MS. WATKINS: Well, I would like to use Mr. Skilling\'s own words to describe what I thought about his testimony. He was interviewed by Enron\'s in-house newsletter in 2001. In the interview Mr. Skilling was asked, What\'s the best advice you ever received? And his reply was, ""If it doesn\'t make any sense, don\'t believe it."" (Laughter.)\' REP. GREENWOOD: Did you confront Mr. Skilling himself with this concern? MS. WATKINS: No, sir, I did not. REP. GREENWOOD: Why did you not? MS. WATKINS: I did not want to do that without the safety net of a job in hand. I felt like it would be an immediate job-terminating move. Frankly I thought it would be fruitless, that nothing would happen. REP. GREENWOOD: And what led you to -- did you have other experiences or were there experiences of others that led you to believe that that might be -- that you might be putting your job on the line if you were to confront Mr. Skilling -- or Mr. Fastow for that matter -- with these concerns? MS. WATKINS: Basically it appeared that the Raptor transactions had been going on for a number of years. My understanding was that Mr. Skilling was fully aware of them. He is a very hands-on manager. I had also heard rumors that people as close to him as Mr. Baxter had complained to him and he had done nothing. So I really felt it was fruitless to go to Mr. Skilling. REP. GREENWOOD: Do you think it\'s possible that Mr. Skilling was unaware of the natures of these transactions? MS. WATKINS: No, I do not. REP. GREENWOOD: Could you tell us why that\'s not possible? He seemed to have forgotten about them. MS. WATKINS: He is a very much intense, hands-on manager. He was very involved in Mr. Fastow\'s endeavors, and I find it very hard to believe that he was not fully aware of transactions with Mr. Fastow\'s partnerships. REP. GREENWOOD: Now, did Mr. Fastow learn that yo had communicated your concerns to Mr. Lay? MS. WATKINS: I did find out that he found out that I was the writer of the anonymous letter, and that I had also met with Mr. Lay. I found that out August 30th, 2001. REP. GREENWOOD: And how did he respond? Did he name you employee of the month? (Laughter.) MS. WATKINS: Well, Ms. Olson told me that she and Ken Lay were both highly alarmed by Mr. Fastow\'s reaction: he wanted to have me fired, he wanted to seize my computer. REP. GREENWOOD: Wanted to have you fire? He told people he wanted to have you fired? MS. WATKINS: That\'s what Ms. Olson told me. REP. GREENWOOD: Okay. And he wanted your computer? MS. WATKINS: Yes. REP. GREENWOOD: And did he obtain your computer? MS. WATKINS: Ms. -- he did, but Ms. Olson basically said, Let me send you to your office with an IT person -- here\'s a new laptop -- transfer whatever files you want to on the new one -- delete whatever ones you want to on the old one -- we\'ll just hand him the hardware. She said, You don\'t mind doing that, do you? And I said, No, I don\'t. (Laughter.) REP. GREENWOOD: So you pulled a fast one on Andy. Let\'s get to your face-to-face meeting with Mr. Lay. Could you describe how he reacted and what your impression of his reaction is, and particularly with regard to what extent it seemed to you, based on his comments, his reactions, that the news that you were bringing to him was surprising or not surprising, was alarming or not alarming, and to what extent it seemed to you that he had an appropriate response that would have convinced you or given you some comfort that he was in fact going to deal with this? MS. WATKINS: Well, he -- he tried to put me at ease. He knew this was probably difficult for me to do, and he recognized that. I handed him my set of documents, and directed him to the Summary of Raptor Oddities document as a talking point. He seemed to take it very seriously. In fact, when he read the quote that I put in that memo about the manager-level employees saying, ""We\'re such a crooked company,"" he winced. You know, that seemed a painful comment to him. He was aware that these Raptor transactions had been presented to the board. But I -- I said my understanding of the way these things are generally presented -- it\'s high-level summaries, and I am not so certain that the true nature was fully disclosed. And he contended that I might be right. And by the end of the discussion he certainly said he would look into it and order an investigation, and ask me what would -- what could he do for me, which was when I requested the transfer out of Mr. Fastow\'s group. REP. GREENWOOD: Okay, my time has expired. The chair thanks the recognizes for gentleman Mr. Dingell for 10 minutes for purposes of inquiry. REP. DINGELL: Mr. Chairman, I thank you. Again, I commend you. Ms. Watkins, I want to commend you also. I hope you\'ll understand these questions are friendly, but our time is limited so I therefore have to ask them in a way that gives you an opportunity to answer where possible yes or no. I will be working from a document which is entitled ""Outlines of Points to Discuss with Ken Lay and Jim Derrick."" Ms. Watkins, you specifically asked that Vinson and Elkins not do this investigation. That was because they had approved many of the LJM deals as attorney for Enron, is that correct? MS. WATKINS: Yes sir, it is. REP. DINGELL: Now, I want to refer you to the document that I have just mentioned. This is a document which was prepared by Vinson & Elkins on the result of their investigation. And Jim Derrick is Enron\'s general counsel, is he not? MS. WATKINS: Yes, he is. REP. DINGELL: Ms. Watkins -- and in this document it says that Jim Derrick decided not to engage and independent accountant, as you had recommended. Is that correct? MS. WATKINS: Yes. REP. DINGELL: The caveat on the investigation was that they should not second-guess the accounting treatment, they would not do a detailed transaction analysis, and there would be no discovery-style investigation. Did you know that at this particular time or at some later time? MS. WATKINS: I was not aware that the investigation was being limited. I met with Vinson & Elkins on September 10th for roughly three hours and had no indication that it was a limited investigation. I only discovered that it was limited when I -- when I read their October 15th response, which was not provided to me -- read it off of this committee\'s webpage. REP. DINGELL: It is fair to say that this then was not much of an investigation, was it? MS. WATKINS: I don\'t think so. REP. DINGELL: Vinson & Elkins said that with all these caveats, there was no problem except a cosmetic one, is that correct? MS. WATKINS: That is what they concluded. REP. DINGELL: And on page seven, Vinson & Elkins tells Ken Lay that Enron\'s stock is being used to support transactions with Condor and Raptor. Enron was getting earnings through derivative transactions with Raptor when it could be argued that there was no third party involved, and because of the falling value of both Enron\'s stock and asset value, the question was raised as to who bears the loss. These are exactly the same questions you had asked earlier, isn\'t that so? MS. WATKINS: Yes sir. REP. DINGELL: Now, then Vinson & Elkins says at page eight of the document, notwithstanding these bad cosmetics, Enron representatives uniformly stated that Condor Raptor vehicles were -- (inaudible) -- useful vehicles that benefitted Enron. What this says to me is that everyone -- Vinson & Elkins, Ken Lay, Jim Derrick, and all the people they interviewed knew that these were not special purpose vehicles that bore risk, is that correct? MS. WATKINS: It would appear to be so, yes. REP. DINGELL: And they knew that they were in bad financial shape, did they not? MS. WATKINS: Yes. REP. DINGELL: And they had approved them, had they not? MS. WATKINS: Yes. REP. DINGELL: So, when high level officials say they didn\'t know about those vehicles, can that be true? MS. WATKINS: No. They knew about they vehicles. REP. DINGELL: No, what do you think all these people expected to happen at this point in September 2001? MS. WATKINS: I think what\'s -- what\'s interesting to note is that it says here the ""Raptor vehicles were clever, useful vehicles that benefitted Enron."" I think that there was an understanding that Andersen and Vinson & Elkins had blessed these things, that -- you know, when I met with Rex Rogers on August 17th, he said, ""Sherron, how could you possibly be right? I mean, Andersen and Vinson & Elkins would not risk their firms giving us wrong advice. They\'ve blessed these structures."" And so I -- I think that certain people at Enron thought that these were complex but clever and that they were legitimate. REP. DINGELL: So, now -- so here we have a situation where Vinson & Elkins does -- I think they had to -- some kind of due diligence or gave legal advice to Enron on these matters, is that not so? MS. WATKINS: Yes sir. REP. DINGELL: The accountant was in a similar position, both as accountant and as consultant, is that not so? MS. WATKINS: Yes, that\'s right. REP. DINGELL: So, am I fair in inferring from this that their statements about the character of these devices as being of benefit to Enron was in error? MS. WATKINS: Well, a benefit to Enron, if you consider that we were meeting financial statement targets that we had told investor- analysts, but you can\'t meet those targets falsely. REP. DINGELL: So, they were -- they were essentially represented as being of benefit in the meeting of targets which could not be met? MS. WATKINS: Yes sir. REP. DINGELL: Mr. Chairman, in the interests of time, I would like to just ask unanimous consent to introduce the document to which I have referred. And again, Ms. Watkins, you are a women of extraordinary courage. We thank you for your assistance. REP. GREENWOOD: Without objection, the document to which the gentleman from Michigan refers, and all of the other documents in the binder will be made a part of the record. The chair recognizes the gentleman, Mr. Tauzin. REP. TAUZIN: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. First, Ms. Watkins, I apologize that we scheduled this hearing on Valentine\'s Day. I want to wish you Happy Valentine\'s. MS. WATKINS: Thanks. REP. TAUZIN: I want to refer specifically to the document which you handed Ken Lay on October the 30th. That document has been widely publicized in the last several days. Some have characterized it as an attempt to describe a public relations effort to help the company through this problem. I want you to tell me whether the facts outlined in that document are, to your best knowledge and belief, true. MS. WATKINS: Yes sir. I was providing this to Mr. Lay as a concept on public relations, however, I felt it was a truthful public relations strategy in it was something I felt should be -- should be said. REP. TAUZIN: So that the things you recommended that Mr. Lay say and do are based upon facts in this document that you believe to be true? MS. WATKINS: Yes. I do believe that Mr. Skilling and Mr. Fastow, along with two very well respected firms, did dupe Ken Lay and the board. REP. TAUZIN: Most specifically you say that. You say that as CEO, Mr. Lay relied upon his COO, Mr. Skilling, as well as CFO Fastow, and CAO Causey, to manage the details. Is that correct? MS. WATKINS: Yes. REP. TAUZIN: Is that accurate? Did Mr. -- was Mr. Skilling expected to manage the details of these transactions? MS. WATKINS: From all the records and the presentations that I have reviewed, Mr. Skilling was supposed to be an integral part of the controls and the review process with the LJM transactions. REP. TAUZIN: Now, did you his -- did you see Mr. Skilling\'s testimony last week before this committee? MS. WATKINS: Yes sir, I did. REP. TAUZIN: Did you specifically hear his testimony regarding the LJM approval sheets? MS. WATKINS: Yes, I did. REP. TAUZIN: Now, he basically testified that he never saw these sheets and he was not required to sign them, that\'s why he didn\'t sign them. Is it your testimony that he in fact knew about these sheets? MS. WATKINS: Well, all I can say is -- all I can speak to is that it was Enron\'s very strict policy, when completing transactions and deals, to have deal sheets, deal approval sheets, and there was never a name put on the approval block that was not required. And I don\'t ever remember an instance where signatures were not obtained for every person listed. REP. TAUZIN: So that if Mr. Skilling\'s name consistently appears on the sheets but it remains unsigned, it was not because he was not obligated to sign it, it was because he just didn\'t sign it. MS. WATKINS: That\'s correct. REP. TAUZIN: Is that correct? MS. WATKINS: That\'s -- that would be my understanding of our very strict procedures, yes. REP. TAUZIN: Were those procedures that Mr. Skilling would have understood? MS. WATKINS: Yes. REP. TAUZIN: You say that, also in the memo, that Mr. Lay, should admit that he trusted the wrong people. Are you saying that Mr. Lay was wrong to trust Mr. Skilling and Mr. Fastow and Mr. Causey with these details? MS. WATKINS: yes sir, I do believe they mis-served Mr. Lay, the board, Enron and its shareholders. REP. TAUZIN: In fact, you go on to say that Ken Lay his board were duped by a COO who wanted the targets met no matter what the consequences, a CFO motivated by personal greed, and two of the most respected firms, Arthur Andersen and company and Vinson & Elkins, who had both grown too wealthy off Enron\'s yearly business and no longer performed their roles as Ken Lay, the board, and just about everybody on the street would expect as a minimum standard for CPAs and attorneys. Do you believe that statement to be true? MS. WATKINS: Yes sir, I do. REP. TAUZIN: You say further on, ""the culprits are Skilling, Fastow, Glisson, Causey, as well as Arthur Andersen and Vinson & Elkins."" Do you believe that statement to be true? MS. WATKINS: Yes sir, I do. REP. TAUZIN: Now, in Mr. Skilling\'s testimony, he very specifically denied any knowledge that in these transactions Enron Corporation had not properly transferred the risk to cover the losses. Do you believe that statement to be true? MS. WATKINS: No, I do not. Mr. Skilling was a great proponent of looking to the markets to make sense of a transaction. And I doubt we could have hedged these volatile stocks with any true unrelated third party at the prices that we were actually able to obtain from Raptor. REP. TAUZIN: Is it your testimony, then, that Mr. Skilling must have known about the details of the Raptor transaction to know that risk had not transferred? MS. WATKINS: It is my opinion that he was probably aware that we could not have transacted at those prices with an unrelated third party, and the only reason Mr. Fastow was transacting with Enron through the Raptor transaction at those prices for volatile stocks was that Mr. Fastow could not lose money and he was backstopped by Enron stock. REP. TAUZIN: Ms. Watkins, you made it as clear as I\'ve ever seen anybody make it. You basically outlined for Mr. Lay what would happen if he did the right thing -- cleaned up this mess, reported correctly to his stockholders and investors, if he got rid of the culprits and if he made these public statements on behalf of the corporation, that he, in fact, was going to do everything to save his company; and that if he didn\'t take that advice, you told him, the worst is going to happen, it\'s going to happen anyhow, and Mr. Lay will be more implicated in this than is deserved. What did you mean by that? MS. WATKINS: Mr. Lay was back at the helm as CEO. And it is my humble opinion that he did not understand the gravity of the situation the company was in. REP. TAUZIN: Now, you explained to him, as the chairman has outlined, in rather detailed form, what you thought was wrong with Raptors, what you thought was wrong with these transactions. Did he understand the gravity, the implications of what you were telling him, in your opinion? MS. WATKINS: In my opinion, I don\'t think he did. And I have that opinion because at an October 23rd all-employee meeting to discuss the (write-downs?) that had occurred in the third quarter, there were several questions about Raptor and about the LJM transactions. And Mr. Lay likened the problem the company was now facing to a 1980s problem, when the Peruvian government nationalized an oil company Enron had, to the (J-Block?) problem Enron had in 1997. And I don\'t think an accounting manipulation problem is in any way related to a -- REP. TAUZIN: You\'re saying he didn\'t get it. MS. WATKINS: No. REP. TAUZIN: He didn\'t get it. Now, as I understand your memo to him, you\'re basically telling him that these officials of his corporation were engaging in these essentially improper activities, were doing it in a way that he and his board were being duped, kept in the dark. Who had the power to protect those people from discovery from Mr. Lay and his board? Who had the power to allow these activities to go forward by all of these employees, including investing themselves in some of these outside partnerships and entities at great profit? Who had the power to let all that happen and keep that information from the board and Mr. Lay all that while? MS. WATKINS: My opinion would be that would be Mr. Skilling. REP. TAUZIN: And finally, Ms. Watkins, I refer you to the document entitled ""Lessons Learned,"" tab eight. In that document, there are three points: Recognizing, in effect, the accounting hedge versus an economic hedge; the operation should consider hedging assets in Raptor to minimize credit capability volatility. The new Raptor structure transferred risk in the form of stock dilution. Did you show this document to Mr. Lay? MS. WATKINS: Yes, I did. REP. TAUZIN: Now, it changes handwriting. Whose handwriting is that? MS. WATKINS: That\'s my handwriting. REP. TAUZIN: The handwriting basically says, to the final point, ""There it is. That is the smoking gun. You cannot do this."" What did this mean? MS. WATKINS: Well, my concern was that this was a document Enron had produced. It was well-known. And what that bullet point is trying to say in plain English is that the new Raptor structure transferred income statement equity investment risk in the form of stock dilution. And you can never use your stock to invest the income statement. REP. TAUZIN: You just can\'t do that legitimately, legally. MS. WATKINS: That\'s correct. REP. TAUZIN: Where\'d you get this document? MS. WATKINS: From the risk assessment and control group, run by Mr. Richard Buy. REP. TAUZIN: And, if I may, what was Mr. Lay\'s reaction to this document when you showed it to him? MS. WATKINS: He was concerned. He was concerned with everything I was telling him. REP. TAUZIN: There\'s another note you wrote on the second point. ""The corporation isn\'t Raptor. How could corporation consider anything at Raptor?"" What\'d you mean by that? MS. WATKINS: Well, the bullet point just -- this is ""Corp should consider hedging assets in Raptor to minimize problems."" And if Raptor is supposed to be Mr. Fastow\'s company, then it\'s Mr. Fastow\'s problem. Why should Enron Corporation -- REP. TAUZIN: It\'s not the corporation. MS. WATKINS: -- consider anything (there?)? Exactly. REP. TAUZIN: Even with this, you still say he didn\'t get it. MS. WATKINS: I don\'t think so. REP. TAUZIN: Thank you, ma\'am. REP. GREENWOOD: The chair thanks the gentleman and recognizes the gentleman from Florida, Mr. Deutsch, for 10 minutes. REP. DEUTSCH: Thank you, Ms. Watkins. Someone reading through Enron\'s (statement?), would they have a perspective that those statements fairly represent the status of the company prior to the -- (inaudible)? MS. WATKINS: I don\'t think so. I think that related-party footnote is wholly inadequate in describing the transactions with Mr. Fastow\'s partnership. REP. DEUTSCH: Okay. So I think all of us would probably agree with what you just said. How was that able to happen? How were we able to get to the seventh-largest company in America, under what we consider general accounting principles, that those statements are supposed to fairly represent what\'s going on in the company, and you and me and, I think, anyone who\'s looked at this could come to the same conclusion that they do not? How did that happen? MS. WATKINS: It\'s inconceivable, and I don\'t understand how it happened. REP. DEUTSCH: And obviously it happened. I mean, at some point in time, someone had to have had discussions between people at Enron and their accountants, Arthur Andersen, and their attorneys, Vinson & Elkins. I mean, are you aware of discussions that would have allowed it to happen? MS. WATKINS: I can really just point to what Mr. Stupak said in ""The Emperor\'s New Clothes."" There were swindlers in ""The Emperor\'s New Clothes"" discussing the fine material that they were weaving. And I think Mr. Skilling and Mr. Fastow are highly intimidating, very smart individuals, and I think they intimidated a number of people into accepting some structures that were not truly acceptable. REP. DEUTSCH: This is somewhat of a sidelight, but I think something significant. At the time that you were obviously aware of what was going on -- I mean, that the statements of the company did not reflect, in fact, huge losses, in the billions of dollars, so what the value of Enron was, as reflected in its stock price, was not its true value, and there were people obviously in Enron that knew about this. And apparently what we know -- and I\'m trying to get a copy at this point, but it\'s a public domain at this point -- that effectively dozens of management people were selling hundreds of millions of dollars worth of stock at this period of time. So obviously people knew what was going on because my recollection is that there was only one actual purchase with dozens of sales. Was that the sort of culture of what was going on in terms of the inside management at this point in time, understanding, in fact, what you uncovered and what we know now, that the value was not -- that the liability of these Raptors was not reflected in the statement? MS. WATKINS: It\'s hard for me to say about executives who sold stock, because so many of them thought that somehow or other this was legitimate. I\'m -- REP. DEUTSCH: Legitimate, but they also knew that there was an actual loss out there; and legitimate also that it seems as if everyone understood that the partnership could never make good on that loss. So there was -- so people actually understood the partnership, understood that eventually that loss was going to come back to Enron. I mean, it might have been legal, but as a practical matter, in terms of the value of the company, I can\'t imagine how they wouldn\'t know that there was going to be a day of reckoning at some point in time. MS. WATKINS: You could be right. I can\'t really speculate. But there was a feeling -- I mean, Enron is a very arrogant place with a feeling of invincibility. And I\'m not certain people felt like it was that imminent. They just felt like Mr. Fastow, along with the accountants, would come up with some magic in the future. REP. DEUTSCH: Was there any thought at all -- because, again, I guess what I\'m hearing you say and what I\'ve looked at at this point is that anyone -- and I don\'t think you have to be a Harvard MBA at this point or an Arthur Andersen partner to understand that there were liabilities were not requested in the balance sheet of (the company?), huge liabilities, in the billions of dollars. And if you knew that and the market and the transparency of the public markets, you knew the stock was going to go down at some point. Was there any concern at all for shareholders, for employees who had 100 percent of their life savings in 401(k)s, to retired people throughout the country who had investments in Enron stock, who really have been devastated by this collapse of Enron? And was there any thought, any discussion of what this would mean to actual shareholders? MS. WATKINS: I never heard any discussion. REP. DEUTSCH: Did you have any sense at all that there was any concern for shareholders at all? MS. WATKINS: I don\'t recall any discussions of concerns like that. REP. DEUTSCH: You have testified -- and, you know, you have used the word, I guess, ""improper."" I feel comfortable using the word ""illegal,"" because, you know, I guess sometimes I debate whether to go into -- you know, what level of detail in terms of these transactions. But I think we have to go into some detail really to understand them, and also just to have it on the record in this sense. The hedging, okay, of (Vichy?), all right, that would have been a normal business decision. What was the original investment of the (Vichy?)? Do you know the details? MS. WATKINS: I don\'t have exactly what was -- REP. DEUTSCH: Do you have a ballpark number? MS. WATKINS: I really don\'t. I think it was under $10 million. REP. DEUTSCH: Okay, and what was the price when the hedge was put into effect, the value? MS. WATKINS: I believe around $166 or $170 a share. REP. DEUTSCH: So the value was $166 million at that point or more? MS. WATKINS: Enron\'s value was probably in excess of $150 million by then. REP. DEUTSCH: Okay. So the idea was to hedge that increase. And what you have said and what you\'ve testified to is, first of all, could they have gone to a legitimate third party, an investment bank, to buy a derivative, to buy a put for the strike price? Was that available? MS. WATKINS: I believe we had some hold restrictions on the stock, but probably there were some transactions, derivative transactions, that were available to us from unrelated parties. REP. DEUTSCH: Okay. And, again, just to kind of walk through the specific transaction, so in a ballpark number, what would an unrelated third party ask for to sell that type of put to lock in that gain? Just a ballpark number. MS. WATKINS: Well, I don\'t think you could have locked it in at that $170 price. REP. DEUTSCH: Right. MS. WATKINS: There would have been a significant haircut to that price. REP. DEUTSCH: Right. Can you use real numbers? MS. WATKINS: As much as -- REP. DEUTSCH: I\'m sorry. What? MS. WATKINS: As much as -- as much as, I would say, 30 or 40 percent. REP. DEUTSCH: Okay. And that strike price would be what number? MS. WATKINS: Probably more like $120 or $110; maybe even lower. I\'m -- REP. DEUTSCH: Okay. And then what was the price that was sold by the partnership, by the Raptor? MS. WATKINS: I don\'t believe that we have sold it. I believe the (Vichy?) is selling for -- REP. DEUTSCH: No, no, the put. MS. WATKINS: I think $170 a share. REP. DEUTSCH: No, no, but what was the -- what did it cost Enron to buy it from this partnership? MS. WATKINS: I\'m not familiar exactly with those details. REP. DEUTSCH: A ballpark, about -- MS. WATKINS: Well, I don\'t know exactly how the Raptor puts or fees were paid. I do know that approximately 35 million went to Mr. Fastow or went to LJM out of the Raptors, and that that was supposedly representing fees. But that was for all of the -- REP. DEUTSCH: Right, and I guess -- this is where, you know, I think we have crossed the line of a legal activity. Because what I hear you saying is that that transaction which you have just described, which was one of many transactions -- and basically there was this sort of cookie cutter of locking this in. And what appears to have happened is Arthur Andersen and Vinson and Elkins basically gave approval for this cookie cutter in terms of basically locking in value -- you lock in the gain on the balance sheet as a gain. Then you basically have this sham transaction. And that\'s the whole point. What you seem to be absolutely I think convinced of, and what I am as well, is that if a third party would have sold it at a market price and this sort of partnership which was headed by the CFO of the company, Mr. Fastow, as head of the general partnership as the general partner, basically selling it to yourself, and it\'s at a different price than a third-party price. By definition, you know, it\'s not an arm\'s length transaction. I mean, by definition, if the price is so significantly different. That\'s number one. And, number two, what is absolutely clear -- and I think just trying to elaborate on this a little bit, getting into some of the details, that there really -- the transaction never really existed, because as opposed to guaranteeing the gain, the general partnership -- no one in this transaction ever -- I mean, ever contemplated that the general partnership could ever guarantee the gain. I mean, they could only guarantee the gain if the stock went up and Enron\'s stock went up. Is that accurate? MS. WATKINS: Yes, it is. The saying around Enron was that heads, Mr. Fastow wins; tails, Enron loses. REP. DEUTSCH: And that obviously is not a transaction? MS. WATKINS: No. REP. DEUTSCH: That\'s not a business transaction. I mean, that\'s not a transaction that -- I mean, could you contemplate in any shape, manner or form that there was a business purpose? MS. WATKINS: No, other than -- other than making sure those losses were not borne by Enron\'s financial statements, which is not economic. REP. GREENWOOD: The time of the gentleman has expired. REP. DEUTSCH: Thank you. REP. GREENWOOD: The chair would note the presence of the gentleman from Oklahoma, Mr. Largent, and would also note that this is his last day as a member of the United States House of Representatives. He has long been a valued, respected, and I would say admired, member of this committee. We value his contribution. I understand that the gentleman does not have time to inquire -- or he does? REP. STEVE LARGENT (R-OK): Mr. Chairman, all I wanted to do was ask unanimous consent to submit my opening statement for the record. REP. GREENWOOD: Without objection, the gentleman\'s opening statement will be part of the record, and the chair and the committee wishes him well in his future endeavors, and recognizes the gentleman from North Carolina, Mr. Burr, for 10 minutes to inquire. REP. BURR: I thank the chair. We will miss Steve Largent. Sherron, once you started to look for the problems, how long did it take you to identify the degree of problems that existed in some of these transactions? MS. WATKINS: Actually not very long. I mean, I did know from the footnote that Enron had recognized $500 million of revenue in 2000 from the Raptor hedging transaction. Five hundred million is a significant number when you look at our net income for 2000. As soon as I discovered that the losses at Raptor were backstopped by Enron, and that\'s the way the structure worked, I knew we had a very large problem. REP. BURR: Could anybody charged with a review of what took place in these partnerships have missed it? MS. WATKINS: I don\'t think so. And I was highly alarmed that this had occurred, and allowed to go on for so long. REP. BURR: Did you feel like the letter that you had sent to Mr. Lay really did lay out a blueprint of what people should look at if they were outside concerns looking in at these transactions? MS. WATKINS: Yes, I did. REP. BURR: Let me go to the Vinson and Elkins -- I think this was a preliminary outline that they used that Mr. Dingell just put in the record. It was used to discuss -- to be a discussion graph with Mr. and Mr. Derrick. And specifically I want to go to item D, caveats, first one. And in that it says, ""No second guessing of accounting treatment by AA."" Interpret that for me, if you will. MS. WATKINS: That they did not want Vinson and Elkins to make any or give any opinions regarding whether the accounting treatment was proper -- just assume that it was. REP. BURR: Let me move to your meeting with Mr. Lay I think on August 22nd. You said you spent almost an hour. He seemed surprised by a lot of the things. But he made some commitments to you he\'d look into it, didn\'t he? MS. WATKINS: Yes, he did., REP. BURR: Having left that meeting, was there ever an exception that Mr. Lay made relative to these accounting discrepancies that you raised, that he wasn\'t going to look at those, but he might look at something else? MS. WATKINS: No, I understood that he was going to try to get to the bottom of my concerns. REP. BURR: Is there any way that what you shared with him could have been heard in a way that you could do an independent review of these transactions, leaving out second-guessing accounting treatment, and believe that you could fully understand what you had raised with him? MS. WATKINS: No. The point is the accounting treatment. The point is the accounting disclosures in the footnotes to the financial statements. REP. BURR: When you left that meeting with Ken Lay, did it ever cross your mind that they would turn to somebody who already had a relationship with Enron, be it Vinson and Elkins or Andersen, to actually do the review of their own work? MS. WATKINS: I didn\'t think they would choose V&E. I was slightly -- well, more than slightly disappointed to find out that they subsequently did choose Vinson and Elkins to conduct the investigation. REP. BURR: Did Mr. Lay stress with you that he would have a review done that was independent or that was thorough? MS. WATKINS: He stressed that he would get to the bottom of it. He would look into my concerns. He didn\'t really go into detail as to what he was going to do to do that. REP. BURR: I think that this discussion outlined for the meeting really lays out that no second guessing accounting treatment by Arthur Andersen, no detailed transaction analysis. And it seems that V&E was given very specific instructions: We need you to produce a report. We need you to stamp it okay -- but don\'t raise any questions about any of these things that have been brought to our attention. Is that pretty much what he did? MS. WATKINS: Well, it appears from this V&E document that they had a very limited scope. REP. BURR: Sherron, prior to the release of V&E\'s final report, they briefed your orally, I think on 10/16. Is that correct? MS. WATKINS: They -- I think they had issued their report. I had not seen it. I didn\'t see it until this year. They briefed me after the earnings release that morning. REP. BURR: And was that the first time that you knew that Vinson and Elkins had turned to Arthur Andersen to play a part in their review of the accounting discrepancies that you had raised that they had already signed off on? MS. WATKINS: Yes. That was -- it was roughly a two-hour meeting where Joe Dilg and Max Hendrick (ph) went through how they had conducted their investigation. The reason they said that they chose to have Arthur Andersen relook at their own work was in the interest of time -- that the company wanted a speedy response, and no other accounting firm could get up to speed on these transactions very quickly. But they also told me other things that -- where they had limited their investigation, despite suggestions that I had given them on September 10th, when we had initially met for three hours at the beginning of the investigation. REP. BURR: What was your reaction to that? MS. WATKINS: I was highly alarmed. I did not think it was good advice for Mr. Lay. They told me that the conclusion was the accounting was appropriate when done. The cosmetics were bad, but it was appropriate. And I felt like that was -- especially since I knew that we had unwound these transactions and written off a billion two in shareholder equity that very morning. We happened to close that day at $33 a share, the same -- about the same price we had opened with that morning. But my concern was that that wasn\'t going to stick, that I gave it less than a 5 percent probability that this was going to go quietly. And I was highly concerned that not only had the Titanic hit the iceberg, but we were already tilting. REP. BURR: Is it safe to say you didn\'t feel like the commitment that Mr. Lay had made to you to get to the bottom of it had successfully been accomplished? MS. WATKINS: Yes, that\'s correct. I did not feel that. REP. BURR: Sherron, one last question, if I can -- and it really deals with Enron management and their interaction between themselves and their audit firm. Are you aware at any point in that relationship as these partnerships were created, or as they fell, where Enron management in any way, shape or form used anything persuasive to encourage Andersen to turn their head or shut their eyes at the structure or the outcome of these partnerships? MS. WATKINS: I don\'t think it was a turn-the-head kind of deal. Mr. Rogers, when I met with him August 17th, he did say, Well, we push our internal accountants quite hard. He mentioned we probably push our outside auditors pretty hard. So he seemed to indicate that there was probably a lot of pressure that Enron put on Andersen to accept the structures that Enron was developing around the Raptor vehicles. REP. BURR: And given the timing of the V&E briefing with you, which was 10/16, which was close to that financial reporting period, can you share with me what V&E said about the 10/16 earnings release? MS. WATKINS: About the earnings release itself? REP. BURR: About that current earnings release -- what they said on 10/16. Did they address the earnings release? MS. WATKINS: Well -- REP. BURR: I think it was a press statement that went out -- I think that was the announcement of the $577 million -- MS. WATKINS: It was -- we had a press release that we had unwound some of the LJM transactions, and taken these write-offs and reductions of shareholder equity in the third quarter. It was my opinion we should restate. And Mr. Dilg responded, Do you really think Mr. Lay should ignore the advice of his counsel in this matter? REP. BURR: Given that you are going through a release from Enron for the $577 million adjustment, and a write-down of $1.2 billion in shareholder equity, how is that consistent with the report that V&E is briefing you on that there\'s no problem s? MS. WATKINS: Well, it was -- it was very surprising to me. I said, Well, if you told Mr. Lay that the accounting was appropriate, why did we unwind these deals? Why take a billion two write-down to equity if these deals were okay? And they said -- their reply to me was that, Well, that was a business decision I believe Mr. Lay felt like that these transactions were a distraction from core business, and he just decided to unwind them. REP. BURR: Sherron, thank you very much. I yield back. REP. GREENWOOD: The chair thanks the gentleman and recognizes the gentleman from Michigan, Mr. Stupak, for 10 minutes. REP. STUPAK: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Ms. Watkins, thanks again for coming. Let me pick up a little bit where Mr. Burr just left off. In this financial statement, there was pressure there to approve these special SPEs and these transactions, and you said a question about Enron putting pressure -- they said, Well, I am sure there\'s pressure on the internal auditors and external auditors. But before a financial statement goes public, doesn\'t Arthur Andersen have at least a fiduciary responsibility to say this ain\'t right, it\'s not going in the financial statement, before it\'s put out to the public? MS. WATKINS: Well, my understanding as a former accountant is that, you know, it\'s an odd situation. The accounting industry is paid by public -- by companies requesting their services. But your -- an accounting firm is supposed to keep their eye on who is relying on their opinions. Outside investors are relying on their opinions. That\'s who they are there to protect. And they make an opinion that these financial statements, including the footnotes, fairly represent the financial condition of the company. REP. STUPAK: If these transactions are questionable, that may not fairly accurately represent the financial position of a company, and they really have the ultimate responsibility before it\'s released to the public to say yes or no to putting these out. Is that a fair statements? MS. WATKINS: Yes, that\'s correct. REP. STUPAK: How about Vinson and Elkins -- would they have the same kind of responsibility on the financial statements? MS. WATKINS: I don\'t -- I don\'t think law firms necessarily have the same responsibility. REP. STUPAK: Let me take you back a few years. Eight years ago -- you said for eight years you worked for Arthur Andersen. MS. WATKINS: Yes. REP. STUPAK: While you\'re at Arthur Andersen did you have any document retention policy back then? MS. WATKINS: I am sure we did. REP. STUPAK: Okay. Then let me ask the question this way: While at Arthur Andersen, how often did you see a memo or correspondence from the higher-ups saying, Just want to remind you all of our retention policy, i.e. destruction policy? MS. WATKINS: I don\'t recall a lot of information about that. That was of course 14 or so years ago, and I am sure the policies have changed. REP. STUPAK: But during your eight years, did you ever remember receiving or seeing one of these memos saying, Just want to remind you of our retention policy? MS. WATKINS: I don\'t recall necessarily any specific memo on that. REP. STUPAK: Okay. In your eight years at Arthur Andersen, for a while you were based in Houston. Did you work on the Enron account then? MS. WATKINS: No, I did not work on the Enron account. REP. STUPAK: Okay. You took Cliff Baxter\'s position as vice president under Mr. Fastow, correct? MS. WATKINS: Well, no. When Mr. Baxter resigned, the whole corporate development function was assigned and put under Mr. Fastow. So I went to work directly for Mr. Fastow with -- helping him in that corporate development area. REP. STUPAK: Did you work under Mr. Baxter before then? MS. WATKINS: Indirectly, yes, I did. REP. STUPAK: Do you have any reason, or do you know why he retired? MS. WATKINS: It was to spend more time with his family. REP. STUPAK: Wasn\'t forced out of the company or anything like that? MS. WATKINS: No. REP. STUPAK: Okay. Is it fair to say that these questionable transactions, the LJM and Raptor -- would they possibly be discovered by the next vice president who went in there? MS. WATKINS: I think they were easy to discover. The facts weren\'t really hidden. REP. STUPAK: Okay. In response to a question from Mr. Dingell, if I heard you correctly, you said Cliff Baxter complained to Mr. Skilling. What did he complain to Mr. Skilling about? MS. WATKINS: My understanding is that Mr. Baxter complained that it was inappropriate for a company of our size, of our stature, to do transactions with the CFO\'s partnership. It was inappropriate, it didn\'t look good -- we should be doing transactions with the CFO\'s partnership. REP. STUPAK: And the CFO at this time was Mr. Fastow? MS. WATKINS: Mr. Fastow. REP. STUPAK: In your opinion, why did Mr. Skilling then leave Enron on August 14th, 2001? MS. WATKINS: It\'s my opinion that he could foresee these problems and he wanted to get away as far away from it as possible. REP. STUPAK: Again some questions from Mr. Dingell -- he indicated when asked about Raptor and LJM the hedging, it was common knowledge how they were doing this, and that it really wouldn\'t stand up, because their assets weren\'t there. Common knowledge by who? MS. WATKINS: The different business units that were hedging their assets with Raptor, as well as the global finance staff under Mr. Fastow. REP. STUPAK: Mr. Dingell actually read a little bit from this one document which he placed on the record -- I believe it\'s on page 8. And it said, ""Notwithstanding these bad cosmetics, Enron representatives uniformly stated that the Condor and Raptor vehicles were clever, useful vehicles that benefited Enron."" So my question -- if they\'re pledged 100 percent with Enron stock, and then they couldn\'t meet the hedges as the stock started to fall, therefore they didn\'t benefit Enron, the employees or other shareholders of Enron, did they? MS. WATKINS: No, they did not. REP. STUPAK: I mean, clever, but not legal and not benefiting Enron? MS. WATKINS: Yes, that\'s correct. REP. STUPAK: Who did they benefit? MS. WATKINS: They -- you could possibly say that they benefited Enron, because it allowed Enron to meet projected financial targets, which kept Enron\'s stock price inflated. REP. STUPAK: Okay. So then that benefit then would go to Enron, but that benefit was then taken out of Enron, was it not? MS. WATKINS: Well, it\'s -- the problem I have with it is it keeps the stock price inflated. And you had Mr. Skilling saying, Our stock price was going to go to $120 per share. So you have people buying that inflated stock price, thinking the stock price is going to go higher. Those are now new shareholders of Enron that certainly are not benefited by these transactions. REP. STUPAK: Okay. Let me ask you this question then. And by no means do I mean anything negative by it. But we have had testimony throughout about how certain employees benefited handsomely financially from some of these transactions and being part of these SPEs. Were you ever offered an opportunity to join in one of these or to be part of one? MS. WATKINS: No, I was not. REP. STUPAK: So it\'s fair to say then you didn\'t invest in any of these SPEs, like some did, that put $5,800 in and they end up coming back with a million within two months or three months? MS. WATKINS: No, I did not. REP. STUPAK: Okay. You indicated -- let me to go this question. In number 8 here, it was in our book here, number 8 -- was the Raptor h edging strategy analysis risk and assessment control. And the chairman asked you some questions about it. In fact, on one page, Lessons learned -- the new Raptor structure transferred risk in the form of stock dilution. And in your handwriting, there it is, that\'s the smoking gun -- ""You cannot do this"" -- and that\'s your handwriting? MS. WATKINS: Yes, it is. REP. STUPAK: Who produced this document? MS. WATKINS: Mr. Rick Buy\'s risk assessment and control group. REP. STUPAK: Do you know when he would have produced it? MS. WATKINS: I believe that this was produced during the first quarter of 2001 to address the fact that the Raptor structures were under water. REP. STUPAK: So risk assessment under Mr. Buy produced this in the first quarter of 2001. Who was this distributed to? MS. WATKINS: I am not completely certain of that. I believe it might have gone as high as the finance committee of the board. But from reading the Powers Report, they do not have appeared to have seen this analysis. REP. STUPAK: So, okay -- and this was an internal document? MS. WATKINS: It probably went certainly to Mr. Fastow -- and I would imagine that it also went to Mr. Skilling. REP. STUPAK: How about Vinson and Elkins? Would they probably receive this? MS. WATKINS: Probably not. REP. STUPAK: Arthur Andersen? MS. WATKINS: Probably not. REP. STUPAK: Okay. But you thought probably the board of directors may have received this? MS. WATKINS: I thought so at the time when I was meeting with Mr. Lay. But from reading the Powers Report it appears that they did not see this. REP. STUPAK: So when you put in here your comments, or even the new Raptor structure transferred risk in the form of stock dilution, not knowing anything about this before this whole Enron thing, even I can pick it up now. Anyone who received this in the company should have realized there were serious, serious problem. And any accountant worth their weight in salt would certainly pick this up, would they not? MS. WATKINS: Well, I mean, it would certainly seem so. But it was so well understood and so prevalent -- that is why I called Mr. Hecker at Andersen. I was about to meet with Mr. Lay, and I thought -- well, I called him, but since I had not been in accounting for over 10 years to say, you know, Could this ever be okay? And he said it didn\'t sound right. And his words to me were, Sherron, any accounting treatment must be clearly defensible if fully exposed. So if this is not clearly defensible when fully exposed, you are probably correct, and you should go see Mr. Lay. REP. GREENWOOD: The time of the gentleman has expired. The chair thanks the gentleman. The chair recognizes the gentleman from Florida, Mr. Stearns, for 10 minutes to inquire. REP. STEARNS: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And, Sherron, let me thank you and also the staff for the prodigious amount of work they have here. Just to get on the record that it is more applicable to the committee that I chair dealing with FASB, I just wanted to ask you some questions. There is ample evidence, as I noted, that Enron at a minimum used -- abused financial accounting standards to confuse its true financial condition. In your view, is Enron indicative of a failure to implement GAAP, generally accepted accounting principles, or a failure of the generally accepted accounting principles -- in other words, failure of the GAAP itself, or a failure to implement these principles? MS. WATKINS: I think Enron had a failure to implement them correctly. REP. STEARNS: So you don\'t think there\'s anything generally wrong with the GAAP itself? Do you think GAAP works? MS. WATKINS: It should work. In my opinion, I think somehow in this country our financial accounting system has morphed into the tax code. And, you know, in the tax accounting, if you follow the codes, whatever result you get, you are justified in using that treatment. In financial accounting, a number of my accounting friends have said if you follow the rules, even if you get squirrely results, you know, you have a leg to stand on. And I am surprised that the financial accounting system has morphed into that, because you should still fairly represent your financial condition. REP. STEARNS: This is to me a very important point. You know, what you are saying is that Enron\'s problem was a flawed corporate strategy, and simple, old-fashioned bad assets, and that the accounting problems did not precipitate it\'s collapse -- is that what you\'re saying? MS. WATKINS: No, I do think the accounting problems precipitated the collapse, because when the investing community was uncertain about our numbers, when they were driving the stock price down, almost everyone was aware that if the stock price dropped too low, if our investment grade rating fell away, there would be additional debt coming due. And we did have an old-fashioned run on the bank. The -- REP. STEARNS: So -- but you are saying that the GAAP worked, and it was -- GAAP was not the problem. The accountants -- it was more the business strategy and how they used the accounting principles, how they implemented it? MS. WATKINS: They did not implement them correctly. REP. STEARNS: Okay. So if you went to the American Institute of Accountants and talked to them, you wouldn\'t recommend that they change anything with Raptor partnerships or LJM 1 or 2, or anything -- you\'d say that\'s not the problem? MS. WATKINS: Well, I don\'t think Enron reported the accounting -- the accounting of these transactions I think was inappropriate. We should not have been able to -- REP. STEARNS: But that was because of the people. That was Mr. Fastow and his people. MS. WATKINS: Yes. REP. STEARNS: But it wasn\'t Arthur Andersen? MS. WATKINS: Well, Andersen also signed off on the way we were implementing these accounting -- REP. STEARNS: But if Arthur Andersen was told something and it was not the truth, they might accept it. Is it possible that Arthur Andersen has some culpability here because they signed off on it? MS. WATKINS: I think so, because they are charged with auditing the results, and a sensitive related-party transaction should get a lot of scrutiny. REP. STEARNS: So, Arthur Andersen, in your opinion, signed off on something they shouldn\'t have. MS. WATKINS: yes. REP. STEARNS: Do you think they knew what they were signing off on? MS. WATKINS: They sure should have known what they were signing off on. REP. STEARNS: Okay. Okay. So, you know, you\'ve been an accountant, it said -- you told me in your opening statement, for 19 years, and yet you\'re the only one here out of this huge organization we have here. And, you know, we have talked to Jeffrey McMahon -- McMahon, who is president and chief operating officer. He said he went to Skilling. We talked to Jordan Mintz, who is vice president and general counsel of corporate development. He tried to get Skilling to sign documents. Both Richard Buy, the chief risk officer, and Richard Causey, the chief accounting officer, all somehow were aware of this, and yet you\'re the only one standing here. And so, when you went to Mr. Lay and he came back and said he was going to -- V&E was going to do an analysis -- I think it was on October 31st -- did he say anything to you about maybe firing Vinson & Elkins? MS. WATKINS: I met with Mr. Lay on October 30th and the 31st, and, you know, I was concerned that we -- we needed to restate, come clean, and -- REP. STEARNS: Because this is a key point -- you were -- the report came back and everybody was ready to act on it, and we\'ll clean house and get this thing straightened out, right? Isn\'t that your impression? MS. WATKINS: Well, he had said at the time, ""Well, we have fired Vinson & Elkins and Arthur,"" which I was a little bit surprised. When I met with him the following day, he corrected that and said, ""No, that we had formed this special committee and hired a new law firm and a new accounting firm to look into my concerns."" REP. STEARNS: What was the new law firm named that he said he was going to hire after he replaced Vinson & Elkins? MS. WATKINS: He -- he first said it was Milner (sp) and something, which sort of surprised me because when the announcement came out, it Wilmer, Cutler, and that\'s an easy name to remember. And I - it gave me the impression that Mr. Lay was not making these decisions, that someone else was, and they were just informing him of the decisions. REP. STEARNS: So, he told you earlier, though, that he was going to fire Arthur Andersen and V&E, right? MS. WATKINS: Yes. And I think he misunderstood, though, the -- (inaudible) -- REP. STEARNS: And who was telling him that, do you think? MS. WATKINS: I don\'t know. I\'m not privy to the inner-workings. REP. STEARNS: I talked to Mr. Skilling, and I talked to him briefly about Cliff Baxter, and I just wanted to ask you a question on this. In your memo you said he complained mightily to Mr. Skilling and all who would listen about the inappropriateness of the transaction with LJM. Did Mr. Baxter discuss his concerns about these transactions with you? MS. WATKINS: I -- actually, the last time I spoke with Mr. Baxter was January 15th of this year. I phoned him to give him the heads-up that my memo had been discovered and was in the press, and that it mentioned that executives had warned Mr. Skilling. So I told Mr. Baxter that I had mentioned him specifically and I read to him over the phone exactly what I had written about it. And he said, ""Sherron, you\'re right. You know, I was very concerned about these transaction."" He said, ""But I\'ll tell you what, if I had known there was anything illegal about it, I would have pushed it further."" REP. STEARNS: Did Mr. Baxter tell you that he talked to Skilling frequently about this? I mean, you say ""mightily."" Did he actually say, ""I talked to him 10 times, three times, one time""? MS. WATKINS: When he -- he told me he spoke to him quite often about the inappropriateness of a company of our stature -- REP. STEARNS: Okay. Did Mr. Baxter ever tell Ken Lay -- did Baxter ever say to you, ""I also mentioned it to Kenneth Lay because I was frustrated with Mr. Skilling""? MS. WATKINS: No. The way the culture worked, I don\'t think anyone would have gone around Mr. Skilling to talk to Mr. Lay. REP. STEARNS: Okay. Okay. What about Jeff McMahon. What -- did you actually ever talk to him about any of these problems? MS. WATKINS: I did meet with -- REP. STEARNS: Were you aware of -- that Mr. McMahon, he was -- he met with Skilling. He obviously -- he was the president and chief operating officer, a former treasurer of the company. He recently became president. He said he told Mr. Skilling of his concern over the company\'s many complex partnerships. Did you ever talk to him? MS. WATKINS: On August 21st, I met with Mr. McMahon for roughly an hour-and-a-half. I mean, that is when he told me that he found the conflicts to be -- to be something that -- you know, too great for Enron. REP. STEARNS: Too great for Enron? MS. WATKINS: Mr. McMahon did not characterize it as a bonus discussion with me. He characterized it as more of an ultimatum that he was giving Mr. Skilling -- you know, make these changes or I can\'t stay as treasurer. And I -- and as I recall the -- Mr. McMahon telling me, he felt like that was a strong statement to Mr. Skilling. And, you know, a few days or weeks later he gets a call saying -- from Mr. Skilling -- that Mr. Skilling wanted him to go join a new venture, Enron Networks. And Mr. McMahon told me that he felt like Mr. Skilling was setting him up for a fall. REP. STEARNS: I asked Mr. Skilling about Mr. McMahon and this conversation. He said, ""We talked nothing about what you mentioned, Congressman. All we talked about was compensation."" I don\'t know if you heard Mr. Skilling say that. MS. WATKINS: It sounds like that\'s -- REP. STEARNS: So, Mr. McMahon -- MS. WATKINS: -- the truth, but not the whole truth. REP. STEARNS: Right. So, Mr. Skilling is trying to convince me they\'re talking about the bonus for Mr. McMahon, and that\'s all they talked about, yet it was clear to me and all the information we had, that Mr. McMahon was telling him about the stuff that you just know about. And that\'s -- and that\'s what you\'re saying, that when you talked to Mr. McMahon, that he told you the same thing, that he talked to him all about these partnerships. MS. WATKINS: He -- the Raptor transactions had not been done, I don\'t think, or -- I\'m not completely aware. Mr. McMahon told me he did not talk about accounting issues as much as they were -- these deals were likely not benefitting Enron shareholders, they were likely benefitting Mr. Fastow and not Enron shareholders. REP. STEARNS: Okay. So that is directly opposite to what Mr. Skilling told us. And you\'re telling us that Mr. McMahon told you that, and Mr. McMahon has also told us that\'s what he told him. So, I think it\'s clear at this point that there\'s two witnesses here that do not agree with what Mr. Skilling has said. I think my time is up, Mr. Chairman. Unless Ms. Watkins would like to clarify -- REP. GREENWOOD: Did you want -- did Ms. Watkins, did you want to clarify anything? MS. WATKINS: Well, I just wanted to add that I had also heard from one of Mr. Baxter\'s close friends that he had a conversation with Mr. Skilling in March of 2001. Mr. Baxter\'s recollection of the meeting was that he told Mr. Skilling ""we are headed for a train wreck, and it is your job to get out in front of the train and try to stop it."" REP. STEARNS: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. REP. GREENWOOD: The chair recognizes the gentle lady from Colorado, Ms. DeGette, for 10 minutes. And we would note that at the end of her questioning, we will recess for approximately 20 minutes for the vote. REP. DIANA DEGETTE (D-CO): Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Ms. Watkins, before I ask my questions, I just want to welcome you and let you know how impressed I was by your memos and by your testimony. And when I was reading this, I felt sort of a bond with you. And first I thought, well, maybe it was because we were both women of about the same age working the male-dominated field. I thought, no, it\'s not that. Then I said maybe it\'s because we\'re both moms, because moms tend to get -- you know, you can figure out if someone\'s telling the truth. But then I realized no, it\'s not that. What it is is both of our mothers were teachers, as I understand. Your mother taught accounting. My mother taught kindergarten. And then I realized that both perfectly prepared us for the careers we were going to embark on. (Laughter.) And I really want to thank you for coming. I want to ask you, did you write these memos, Ms. Watkins, all by yourself? MS. WATKINS: Yes, I did. REP. DEGETTE: So, if someone said that you ghost -- that someone else, like Mr. McMahon, ghost-wrote these memos, that would not be true? MS. WATKINS: That is not true. REP. DEGETTE: And you wrote these because you were concerned about the future of the company and the future for the shareholders, didn\'t you? MS. WATKINS: Yes. REP. DEGETTE: Did you -- were you aware that Mr. Fastow told the Vinson & Elkins investigators that it was his belief that you were acting in conjunction with a person who wanted Mr. Fastow\'s job? MS. WATKINS: I think that\'s ludicrous. REP. DEGETTE: It\'s not true, is it. MS. WATKINS: No. REP. DEGETTE: Are you surprised Mr. Fastow might think that? MS. WATKINS: I\'m not surprised he would think that. REP. DEGETTE: Why not? MS. WATKINS: I understand that he and Mr. McMahon had a rather contentious relationship. REP. DEGETTE: And so you think he was referring to Mr. McMahon? MS. WATKINS: Yes. REP. DEGETTE: Now, you worked for Arthur Andersen for eight years, but it was a long time ago, right? MS. WATKINS: Yes. REP. DEGETTE: And, you\'re a CPA, right? MS. WATKINS: Yes, I am. REP. DEGETTE: Now, let me ask you this. How long had you been working for Mr. Fastow before you figured out that there were problems with the Raptor SPEs? MS. WATKINS: I\'d say about three or four weeks. REP. DEGETTE: So, all these people who said these were very complex transactions, and there wasn\'t much transparency, it didn\'t take an accounting genius -- although I am sure you are one -- but, I mean, you figured it out in three or four weeks, right? MS. WATKINS: Well, I had the advantage of hindsight, when these structures were clearly under water. And also, I was never shown the complex transactions. I just knew what the facts were. Raptor owed us $700,000 million. No-one had lost that money; Enron shareholders were going to pay for it in the future. So I didn\'t need to see the structure. I knew that that wasn\'t kosher. REP. DEGETTE: Even -- even Congress people like us can figure that out. So, now, you said that information -- in your testimony, you said the information gathered from coworkers helped you come to the conclusion that the Raptor SPEs were financially untenable. It was pretty common knowledge and discussion among the coworkers about these entities, correct? MS. WATKINS: Yes, it was. REP. DEGETTE: Can you tell me how widespread the concern was? MS. WATKINS: The Enron Global Finance Staff knew about it, and various business units that had sold assets to Raptor knew about it. There were whole sections of Enron -- the pipeline group, the trading group -- that had no idea about it. But in a handful of groups, it was widespread knowledge. REP. DEGETTE: Well, what about your group? I mean, did people talk about this commonly? How many people are we talking about? MS. WATKINS: I think a fair number. I mean, one of the things I asked Vinson & Elkins to do was to look at -- a survey had been conducted by Mr. Lay over the Labor Day weekend, and I knew of at least a dozen people who had typed in serious concerns about our accounting. REP. DEGETTE: You knew a dozen people who had typed in concerns? MS. WATKINS: Yes. REP. DEGETTE: Ms. Watkins, would you be willing to share those names with this committee? MS. WATKINS: I can -- I can share certainly at least two because they are in the documents that you are releasing today. REP. DEGETTE: Would you be willing to, in our -- as part of our investigation, to share the rest of them? MS. WATKINS: Well, I can share Jeff Donahue, who was managing director in charge of corporate development. REP. DEGETTE: Okay. MS. WATKINS: Kim Detling (sp), a managing director in corporate development. Michelle Nezzy (sp) Marvin one of the business unit people who hedged assets with Raptor. REP. DEGETTE: Jeff McMahon. MS. WATKINS: I don\'t know whether he typed in comments or not. REP. DEGETTE: Oh, he didn\'t type -- but he was concerned, right? MS. WATKINS: Yes. REP. DEGETTE: Cliff Baxter was concerned. MS. WATKINS: Yes. REP. DEGETTE: If you have other names, perhaps you could work with your counsel and with our staff, because that would help us in our investigation. I\'m wondering if you can try to characterize the atmosphere in the Global Finance Group and maybe elsewhere in Enron -- did everybody know what was going on, but everybody was too afraid to do anything about it? MS. WATKINS: It was rather widespread knowledge that Mr. Ray Bowman had -- was complaining about the Raptor structures and LJM. And Mr. Fastow called him in and gave him, as Mr. McMahon puts it, a high-decibel grilling. And so that, I think, made others -- it was like an off-limits subject. You just didn\'t even want to discuss it around the water cooler. REP. DEGETTE: So, it wasn\'t that everybody certainly at your level, knew but didn\'t care; it\'s that they were afraid to come forward. Would that be a fair characterization? MS. WATKINS: Yes. REP. DEGETTE: Now, why is it that you think Mr. Skilling knew about these issues? MS. WATKINS: Because he was an intense, hands-on manager. REP. DEGETTE: What does that -- can you give us a couple of examples of financial transactions you saw Mr. Skilling get involved in hands-on? MS. WATKINS: Well, for instance, in 1996, when I was still managing the JEDI partnership, we had equity investments in various -- primarily oil- and gas-related companies. That was the year we adopted fair-value accounting, which meant that, as an example, if we paid $100 million for an investment, an oil and gas company, and they drilled a dozen wells that were all successful, if our models showed us that we now thought that company was worth $150 million, we would write that company up by $50 million and recognize $50 million in the income statement. Well, a lot of the models were based off the multiples at which E&P companies trade. They were based off a comparable analysis in the marketplace. Mr. Skilling was very concerned that if the multiples, that might have been as high as seven or eight, cyclically moved down to, say, three or four, then our own models would force us to take a write-down. And he sat in on a number of meetings where I was present where we were trying to devise a real hedging strategy to avoid facing those losses on the income statement. REP. DEGETTE: So he was involved hands-on -- MS. WATKINS: Yes. REP. DEGETTE: -- personally in accounting meetings, talking about accounting treatments of transactions. You saw the transaction sheets that the chairman showed you, the four that had the signature line for his approval. Would it, in your experience, be like Mr. Skilling to not sign those? MS. WATKINS: No. The procedures around our approval sheets were cast in stone. REP. DEGETTE: And were they used in many transactions? MS. WATKINS: Yes. Any capital expended at Enron above a certain amount had a deal approval sheet, and the procedures were very well- identified. And I never recall an instance where the approvals, indicated via the approval signature block, were not obtained. REP. DEGETTE: So if someone sent those to Mr. Skilling and he didn\'t sign them, in your opinion, that would be intentionally? MS. WATKINS: No deal could be done without all those approvals. And quite often it was a verbal approval over the phone, and then it was always followed up by a signature. REP. DEGETTE: Thank you very much. Thank you for coming today. I really appreciate it. REP. GREENWOOD: With the gentlelady\'s remaining time, Mr. Skilling\'s testimony here last week was that while there was a line provided -- his term was there was a line provided for his signature; the form provided for his signature -- that he was advised that his signature was not required. Are you aware of any such distinction with regard to those deal sheets? MS. WATKINS: No, those deal sheets were cast in stone. If it was an either/or, it would say, you know, ""One of the following two signatures are required."" If the name was listed in the signature block, it was required. REP. GREENWOOD: It was required. And there was never any provided for as if he could sign it if he felt like it. MS. WATKINS: No, it was a requirement. REP. GREENWOOD: Do you know anything about Jordan Mintz\'s efforts to get him to sign that sheet? MS. WATKINS: I did not know of those until I heard his testimony here last week. REP. GREENWOOD: Okay. The chair thanks the gentlelady. The committee will recess for approximately 15 minutes. (Recess.) REP. GREENWOOD: The committee will come to order. The chair recognizes Mr. Strickland for ten minutes for purposes of inquiry. REP. STRICKLAND: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Ms. Watkins, toward the end of 1999, while you were working for Enron International, representing the Caribbean region, you negotiated the sale of Promigas, an Enron asset to a special, to a special purpose entity known as White Wing. Is that correct? MS. WATKINS: Yes, it\'s also known by its project name, which is Condor. REP. STRICKLAND: Ok. Enron\'s Caribbean region decided to sell Promigas to Whitewing because Enron\'s risk and finance departments had put out the word that all division should sell merchant assets to White Wing by the end of the 3rd and 4th quarters of \'99. Besides that mandate, was there any other reason for Enron to sell Promigas to Whitewing at that time? MS. WATKINS: No, there was not. REP. STRICKLAND: Ms. Watkins, would you please briefly explain what a merchant asset is for the benefit of this committee? MS. WATKINS: Enron has both merchant assets and strategic assets. Merchant assets are assets considered held for sale -- that we have bought for investment purposes, and that we generally do not intend to hold onto for any length of time. Merchant assets could be fair valued, meaning they could be written up to estimated market value; while strategic assets, if they were worth more than Enron had paid for them, those gains could not be recognized until we sold or disposed of the asset. REP. STRICKLAND: Okay. Now, Enron decided to sell its merchant assets to Whitewing in order to increase its cash flow. Was there any other reason for this decision? MS. WATKINS: I believe that the assets sold to Condor Whitewing, the merchant assets, generated -- I know they generated funds flow from operations for Enron, and I believe that to be one of the sole purposes for selling assets into Condor Whitewing. REP. STRICKLAND: Okay. In fact, cash flow had become a big concern for Enron -- had it not? MS. WATKINS: Yes, that\'s correct. REP. STRICKLAND: Now, Wall Street analysts began to distrust Enron\'s increasingly complex earnings statements, so they started examining the company\'s cash flow. After all, cash is cash. However, since Enron had been manipulating its earnings, its cash flow would appear inadequate compared to its inflated earnings statements. This was a problem for Enron, was it not? MS. WATKINS: Well, I am not certain that Enron was manipulating its earnings at that point in time, but for a commodity trader where you would routinely mark to market positions, you can have earnings that represent the discounted fair value of 10 years worth of profits. You recognize that in the first year, but you would only have cash flow of, say, one tenth of that profit in that year. That is probably not a unheard-of phenomenon with trading companies, but trading companies have PE multiples in the 12 to 14 range. Enron enjoyed a much larger price-to-earnings multiple, and did not want to be characterized as a normal trading company. The analysts were concerned that our funds flow from operations was significantly lower than our earnings. It was a financial performance statistic that they were concerned about, and Enron attempted to fix that first fairly legitimately by securitizing contracts and selling them out to outside third parties. I might want to correct a statement that Mr. Congressman Greenwood made earlier. I do think that the Cactus vehicles, the contract assets securitization vehicles that we did in the early \'90s and \'95, \'96, were legitimate -- were legitimate securitizations. Condor, however, I think was one of the first special purpose vehicles that was backstopped by Enron stock that was kept off balance sheet. And I think one of the main purposes of Condor Whitewing was to generate funds flow from operations for Enron. REP. STRICKLAND: So -- and correct me if I say something that you think is factually inaccurate, but it seems that Enron planned to increase its cash flow by selling these merchant assets to Whitewing during the third and fourth quarters of 1999? MS. WATKINS: That\'s correct, yes. REP. STRICKLAND: Did Enron provide any guarantees to Whitewing for these transactions that you know of? MS. WATKINS: The Whitewing structure was set up such that if the assets that were sold to Whitewing were not liquidated and were not sufficient to repay the investors in Whitewing, then that structure was backstopped by Enron\'s stock. REP. STRICKLAND: So this was a transaction where Enron guaranteed an investment with its own stock? Is that a factually correct statement? MS. WATKINS: These vehicles have been schematically depicted in the Wall Street Journal and in the Houston Chronicle, and a number of press. It supposedly is legitimate. I don\'t quite understand how these things can be off balance sheet when you are -- when you have a claw back to the company and to the company\'s own stock, but somehow or other they appear to be available for use. REP. STRICKLAND: And I am impressed with your background check and your training. And I sit here and I hear you say that, and I am wondering at what point is there some authority that has the ability to explain why something that appears to be illegitimate may be legitimate. Is that a puzzle to you as a professional CPA and a person who is deeply knowledgeable about financial transactions? MS. WATKINS: Well, the Condor structure troubled me, the fact that it was off-balance-sheet troubled me, the fact that we were getting funds flow from operations, a financial performance statistic, from this structure troubled me. And while I was working in the Caribbean business unit we were instructed that we now had new targets -- they were funds-flow targets, and we needed to find a way of selling our merchant assets into Condor Whitewing. It was almost like something that was on paper, not real, because the business unit continued to manage the asset, the counterparty never understood that we had supposedly sold it, and there was an unspoken understanding that we could buy it back at some point in the future. REP. STRICKLAND: Now, after Enron sold Promigas to Whitewing, who managed and operated that company? MS. WATKINS: The Caribbean business unit. It stayed with the Caribbean business unit. REP. STRICKLAND: And that was Enron? MS. WATKINS: Yes, that\'s Enron. But it was not Whitewing personnel that managed it; it was Enron personnel who managed it. REP. STRICKLAND : In fact, the people involved in the day-to- day functioning of Promigas didn\'t even know that they had been -- that it had been sold -- is that correct? MS. WATKINS: That\'s correct. REP. STRICKLAND: Ms. Watkins, who was the general partner of Whitewing? In other words, who ran Whitewing? MS. WATKINS: I believe it was something called an Osprey or something, but it was an Enron entity that was the general partner of Whitewing. REP. STRICKLAND: Would it be possible for you to identify for the committee the individuals who were involved in running this? MS. WATKINS: The administrative running of Whitewing was under Mr. Andrew Fastow, and I believe he had Cheryl Lipshoots (ph) running the Condor Whitewing structure. REP. STRICKLAND: Okay. Now, Enron sold these assets to Whitewing at book value? MS. WATKINS: Yes. REP. STRICKLAND: Compared to market value, is book value a reliable indicator of an asset\'s true worth? MS. WATKINS: The transactions were supposed to be sold into Whitewing at market value. I believe they were all transacted at book value, and we documented the fact that book values were close approximations of market values at that time. REP. DEGETTE: Would the gentleman yield for one second? REP. STRICKLAND: I would yield. REP. DEGETTE: Cheryl Lipshoots (ph) was the secretary to the board of directors of Enron at that time, right? MS. WATKINS: No. REP. DEGETTE: No? Was she employed by Enron? MS. WATKINS: She was employed by Enron under Mr. Fastow -- REP. DEGETTE: Okay, I just wanted to clear that up, that Mr. Fastow was in charge, and Cheryl Lipshoots (ph) was running it, and they were both working for Enron. MS. WATKINS: Yes. REP. DEGETTE: Thank you. Thank you. REP. STRICKLAND: Thank you. I have just a couple more questions, Ms. Watkins. REP. GREENWOOD: You have just a couple of more seconds. REP. STRICKLAND: One more question, Mr. Chairman. Wall Street analysts were beginning to doubt Enron\'s deceptively complex earnings statements, so they began to look at Enron\'s cash flow as a more reliable indicator of the condition of the corporation. To make sure its cash flow appeared proportional to its earnings, Enron decided to increase its cash flow. Is that correct? MS. WATKINS: Yes. REP. GREENWOOD: The time of the gentleman has expired. REP. STRICKLAND: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. REP. GREENWOOD: Ms. Watkins, when you were involved in this transaction to sell assets to Condor, was there a discussion or agreement about whether or not those assets could be sold back and whether there were documents that would reflect that? MS. WATKINS: There were -- as I recall, there were extensive conversations, because Promigas was an important asset for the region. We did not -- we were legally selling it to this Whitewing structure. Legally we were losing control of the asset, and there was a lot of discussion that we wanted it back. We drafted some documents that would be trigger points where the business unit could buy it back. My understanding was that Mr. Causey instructed our business unit that there could be nothing in writing that the business unit could buy it back, or Andersen would not let us have the sale treatment that we were getting in the funds flow statement. REP. GREENWOOD: And that was the purpose of that -- MS. WATKINS: Yes -- REP. GREENWOOD: -- because you would -- if the charade was evident, you wouldn\'t be able to get a tax treatment? The chair recognizes the gentleman from Illinois, Mr. Rush, for 10 minutes. REP. RUSH: I want to thank you, Mr. Chairman, and Ms. Watkins. It\'s very pleasing that you are here. Your testimony has been forthright and I would say without any kind of a value in term\'s of Ms. Temple\'s testimony, it\'s diametrically opposed to the kind of testimony that Ms. Temple presented to this committee, and it is certainly appreciated by the committee -- at least one member of the committee, and I believe that it is appreciated -- your testimony is appreciated by the American public. On what date did you first speak with Cindy Olson, or communicate with her in any way about your concerns about the financial condition of Enron? MS. WATKINS: On the afternoon of August 16th, following the all- employee meeting that had been held that day. REP. RUSH: And how many times did you speak with her about your concerns, and approximately during what time period? MS. WATKINS: She encouraged me to meet with Mr. Lay, which I did do. I then subsequently transferred into Ms. Olson\'s group. I did not have lengthy conversations with her after that about my concerns. I had expressed them to Mr. Lay, and I thought that was the best place to discuss them. REP. RUSH: So did you read your various -- or did Ms. Olson rather read your -- the various letters that you sent to Mr. Lay and the attachments? MS. WATKINS: I only showed her the anonymous letter, the one page. I did not provide her with copies of the other memos. If she obtained them elsewhere, I don\'t know. REP. RUSH: And what was her response when you showed her the anonymous letter? MS. WATKINS: She could -- she was -- clearly understood that this was a serious problem, and she said it would be best if I explained it personally to Mr. Lay. REP. RUSH: Okay, at one time did you -- in your earlier testimony you indicated that you had a discussion with Ms. Olson about Mr. Fastow\'s desire to have you terminated. At what point in the aforementioned series of discussions did you have that -- express that concern to Ms. Olson? MS. WATKINS: When I met with Mr. Lay on the 22nd, I was leaving for a small vacation that Friday, coming back the following Thursday. When I came into the office August 30th, I had messages to immediately go see Ms. Olson. And that is when she told me that Mr. Fastow had wanted to have me fired and wanted to seize my computer. REP. RUSH: Okay. Did she in any way indicate to you how the attitude displayed by Mr. Fastow -- I mean, was he -- did she -- his demeanor? Or how did she exactly -- how did she relate to you what he had said? What was his frame of mind, if you could? MS. WATKINS: She didn\'t give me a lot of details. She just said that he was behaving in a way that was somewhat shocking to her as well as Mr. Lay. REP. RUSH: And what is Ms. Olson\'s relationship with the Enron Corporation? MS. WATKINS: I believe she\'s a senior vice president, or an executive vice president. REP. RUSH: Is she associated at all with the stock fund at Enron? MS. WATKINS: I was not aware of it. I have since seen in some testimony that she is a trustee, but I was not aware of her position with regards to the 401(k) plan. REP. RUSH: And if she was a trustee at the time, when this all was occurring, do you think that she had any fiduciary obligation to at the very least make an investigation into your claims, concerning your claims? MS. WATKINS: I think she probably understood that they were being investigated and by a professional law firm. And I am sure she was waiting to see the results of that investigation. REP. RUSH: And can you be more specific about your concern -- what you said to her about your concerns about Enron\'s financing? I mean, what was her responses to you? Did you -- how did she respond, and did she indicate in any way that she had heard these same kind of concerns from other Enron employees? MS. WATKINS: Well, after Enron declared bankruptcy, or even as we were heading up to it, she seemed to indicate that no one could have seen this coming. She said in fact that I was the only one that had any kind of inkling that we were in the bad condition that we were in. So I don\'t think she had evidence from anyone else, or opinions from anyone else about our condition. REP. RUSH: My time is running down, but I really -- I want to -- if you could just explain to the committee about the culture there at Enron. It seems to me that everybody from the president to the parking lot know that there was -- the parking lot attendant -- knew that there was something going on there. I mean, what -- explain to us about the culture that was prevalent there in the company. MS. WATKINS: Well, I certainly think it was fairly well known about the Raptor transactions within the global finance unit and within the business units that hedged with Raptor. I don\'t think it was well known throughout the company. And the culture -- I mean, Enron was voted most innovative. It was voted one of the best places to work. I mean, it was the job to have in Houston. The atmosphere was electric. It was fun. You were surrounded by bright people, energized - change the world. It was -- you felt somewhat invincible. And, yes, people were arrogant, and it was -- did have a trader kind of mentality that was sometimes tough to live with. But it was always a fun place to work. REP. RUSH: And the -- most people were conscious about their upward mobility in the company, and they thought that the company would be a place to move up fairly quickly? And -- is that -- MS. WATKINS: Everyone was very conscious of what they were contributing in the last six months. The performance ranking system judged you on what you contributed to the company in the last six months -- no old tapes. And so -- and in that sense it was very competitive. REP. RUSH: And Mr. Fastow and Mr. Skilling and others could very easily manipulate that type of concern to help people to overlook some of the transgressions that we are looking into right now? Is that your opinion? MS. WATKINS: Enron paid its people very well. The stock had been performing very well. I think there was a concern by most people that you didn\'t want to rock the boat. REP. RUSH: Do you have any relationship, either a subsequent relationship to the bankruptcy to some of the Enron employees who had been fired from Enron, some of the lower-level employees? MS. WATKINS: I mean, I know several people who have been let go. REP. RUSH: And do you -- there\'s an issue regarding your severance pay. Are you familiar with -- MS. WATKINS: Or lack thereof? REP. RUSH: Lack thereof, right. Can you expound on what you think is the problem with their severance pay and what is the -- why is it at this point in time there are some former Enron employees who have made tremendous amounts of money and who have very generous severance pay, and then there are others who have been forced to live in ways that they\'d never imagined that they would have to live because of the fact that they don\'t have the severance pay. Can you -- do you see a problem there, and what\'s the nature of the problem, and how would you recommend that we go about resolving that issue here? MS. WATKINS: Well, recently it was disclosed -- maybe at salon.com -- but the retention bonuses that were paid the week before the bankruptcy. And the amounts I find -- some of the amounts I find shocking for 90 days retention. And I do not believe that it was in the best interests of creditors to -- yes, we should retain certain people, but I don\'t think they needed to be paid three and four times their base salary to stay for 90 days. And I think it is an insult to the 4,000 people that were let go with $4,000 checks that there are a handful of people -- more than a handful -- that were paid $600,000, a million five, two million -- $450,000 -- I mean, gargantuan sums of money to agree to stay at Enron for 90 days. I am appalled by that list. REP. RUSH: Thank you. I yield back, Mr. Chairman. REP. GREENWOOD: The chair thanks the gentleman, and recognizes the gentleman from Iowa, Mr. Ganske, for 10 minutes. REP. GANSKE: Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and thank you, Ms. Watkins, for coming to the committee. You know, I am outraged at what has happened with Enron -- employees, pensioners, investors -- they have seen their nest eggs disappear, and they speak about unbearable grief. In Iowa we had -- I\'ve spoken to a lot of former employees of the natural gas company that was based in Omaha, merged with the Houston Natural Gas Company, and became Enron, and they have lost everything. I mean, there was even a suicide when a former executive who left the company with millions couldn\'t deal with the collapse of the company. So this is really serious. I do not think this is -- the problems we are seeing with Enron are just an issue of corporate greed in one company. I think that we are seeing problems with companies like Global Crossing, Elan (ph) -- they took -- you know, gave the money to someone else, took some of it back, counted the income as revenue without counting the outgo as expense. Amazon has resorted to pro forma accounting. Shares in Tyco dropped 50 percent on questions of its accounting. So this is a big, big deal -- the biggest bankruptcy in our nation\'s history. I applaud the chairman of the full committee and the chairman of this investigative committee on doing this. Now, Ms. Watkins, just briefly, in a minute, tell me, what was your job around the time that you went to Ken Lay? What were you supposed to be doing for the company? MS. WATKINS: I was gathering a list of all assets that we might consider for sale and looking at the economic impact of sale. So I was looking at the book value, the market value, what kind of gain or loss we might get if we were able to sell that asset for its market value. REP. GANSKE: So you started -- with that information, you started to piece together this whole scenario. Is that what happened? MS. WATKINS: Well, yes, because a number of assets were hedged with Raptor. And my understanding of a hedge is that means you\'ve got a locked-in sales value. And so some of these assets, most notably Avici and New Power, had -- the market values were significant below our book value. But since we had the assets hedged, that should have been really no concern of Enron\'s. It should have been edged with Raptor. And the business units that were helping me pull together this information kept showing me losses that should have been Raptor\'s that were coming back to Enron. REP. GANSKE: Okay. Were you also hearing, you know, scuttlebutt around the company about some of these things that you were seeing? MS. WATKINS: Not accounting impropriety scuttlebutt; just -- REP. GANSKE: Did you ever hear, you know, at the water cooler about somebody who made an investment of $10,000, $15,000, and got millions? MS. WATKINS: No, I did not. REP. GANSKE: Okay. So you\'re gathering all this information together. Did you ever have any trouble getting the information? MS. WATKINS: On the structures and the way they actually worked, no, I did not. It was readily apparent people had various analyses and presentations that they provided me. REP. GANSKE: So then you write a letter to Ken Lay and you say, ""I am incredibly nervous that we will implode in a wave of impending scandals."" I want to read this full paragraph. ""Is there a way our accounting gurus can unwind these deals now? I have thought and thought about how to do this, but I keep bumping into one big problem. We booked the Condor and Raptor deals in 1999 and 2000. We enjoyed a wonderfully high stock price while many executives sold stock. We then try and reverse and fix the deals in 2001, and it\'s a bit like robbing the bank in one year and trying to pay it back two years later. Nice try, but investors were hurt. They bought at $70 to $80 a share, looking for $120, and now they\'re at $38 or worse. We are under too much scrutiny, and there are probably one or two disgruntled (redeployed?) employees who know enough about the funny accounting to get us into trouble."" When you wrote this letter to Mr. Lay, what was going through your mind? Were you afraid? MS. WATKINS: Well, I wanted to impress upon him that this was something that was likely to happen. We were downsizing. We had at this point maybe let go at least 400 or 500 people. REP. GANSKE: But this is bad news, okay, and you\'re writing this -- you originally wrote this anonymously. MS. WATKINS: Yes. REP. GANSKE: Okay, this is really bad stuff. I mean, were you worried that if you go to the president with this type of stuff that this could affect you personally? MS. WATKINS: I certainly was not going to go to Mr. Skilling. I believed and I still believe that Mr. Lay is a man of integrity. He didn\'t shoot the messenger. I\'m still at Enron. And I felt like I could bring the concerns to him. REP. GANSKE: Did you put a personal copy of this somewhere outside of the company? Did you keep a copy of this memo somewhere else? MS. WATKINS: I did. On the day I sent it to Mr. Lay anonymously, I also sent it in an envelope to Mr. McMahon with my name on it. And I talked to him about it that day. REP. GANSKE: Did you keep a copy for your own personal files? MS. WATKINS: Yes, I did. Yes, I did. REP. GANSKE: And where did you keep those files? At home? MS. WATKINS: No. REP. GANSKE: At work? MS. WATKINS: No, in a lock box. REP. GANSKE: In a lock box. So you were enough concerned about this that you wanted to put this somewhere where it couldn\'t be destroyed. MS. WATKINS: Yes. REP. GANSKE: Were you worried about your own personal safety? MS. WATKINS: at times, I mean, just because the company was a little bit radio-silent back to me, so I didn\'t know how they were taking my memos or the investigation. REP. GANSKE: Why would you be worried about your personal safety? MS. WATKINS: Because it was the seventh-largest company in America. REP. GANSKE: And you were dealing with a really powerful problem -- MS. WATKINS: Yes. REP. GANSKE: -- and a really powerful company. I just have to ask you this. When you first learned about this problem at Enron, did you own stock? MS. WATKINS: I have stock in the 401(k) plan and I have stock options. REP. GANSKE: Did you sell any of that stock? MS. WATKINS: Yes, I did. REP. GANSKE: When did you sell it? MS. WATKINS: I sold -- well, I routinely diversified and did not hold that much Enron stock or stock options. I did sell $31,000 worth of stock in late August, and then I sold -- (met?) to myself around $17,000 of stock options in early October. REP. GANSKE: And you sent these memos to Mr. Lay when? MS. WATKINS: August 15th. REP. GANSKE: So around the time that you sent these memos, after you had gathered this data and gotten to know the financial situation of the company, you sold some stock. Why did you sell it? MS. WATKINS: Well, I mean, I could have sold in July at $45. I actually sold in October more out of a knee-jerk reaction to September 11th. When the markets reopened after the terrorist attacks, most stocks did decline. Enron declined into the low 20s. I had virtually no stock options that were in the money in the low 20s. In early October we moved into the mid-30s and even high 30s, and I had two blocks of stock options that were then in the money. And I just -- I think, as many others, I felt some panic and need to get cash, because you just felt like, you know, when was the next attack? What would that impact be on the stock market? REP. GANSKE: So you sold $31,000 at one time and $17,000 at another time? MS. WATKINS: Yes. REP. GANSKE: So $47,000. When you found out -- when you gave the second memo and had the meetings with Mr. Lay -- and then, as we\'ve heard from testimony today, you know, you were concerned that, you know, going back to the same law firm kind of looked like it was a cover-up; things weren\'t happening too much -- did you ever think about, you know, going to Treasury, Justice, the SEC, blowing the whistle on this? This is -- you know, you\'ve outlined potentially criminal behavior. MS. WATKINS: A co-worker of mine asked whether or not -- she knew I had done this, and she asked whether or not I\'d consider going to the SEC on this. And I said, you know, ""I don\'t want to hasten our demise. There are 20,000 employees here whose livelihood is at risk. And if it appears that I hastened the demise of the company, I might be targeted by them. They might confuse the problem as something I caused."" You know, I did not want to hasten the demise. REP. GANSKE: When you had your conversations with Mr. Lay, did he ask you not to share this information with anyone? MS. WATKINS: He did ask me, had I taken it outside? Had I taken it to the SEC or the press? And I said no, I had not done so. And he said, ""Can you please give us time to investigate?"" And I said, ""Oh, most definitely."" REP. GANSKE: Did he give you a timeline? Did you ask him for a timeline? MS. WATKINS: I did not ask him for a timeline, but he seemed to indicate that they would look into it rather quickly. REP. GANSKE: Well, we all know -- and you, as an accountant, could see the problems coming. I mean, you wrote about an impending implosion. This must have weighed quite heavily on your mind in terms of thinking about, well, what happened both to your fellow employees, as they were locked in, and investors around the country. Tell me what you were feeling about that time -- MS. WATKINS: Well -- REP. GANSKE: -- specifically on whether you had an ethical obligation to let this be known. MS. WATKINS: I don\'t -- I wasn\'t thinking legally. I really felt like I could not go outside of the company. Enron was full of bright people. There were maybe calm ways of addressing this. I mean, having it hit the press in an inflammatory way would definitely hasten the demise. And I wanted to make sure that we had researched everything thoroughly, because what I wanted to do was restate, come clean, but with some contingency plans, how to make sure our trade counter- parties had confidence in our survival, maybe shore up some equity and finance deals, knowing that we were going to face hard times. But just to go to the press or to go to the SEC would have not given Enron a chance to try to fix it calmly. And most definitely this news would have been inflammatory and we would be in the same position we\'re in right now. REP. GREENWOOD: The time of the gentleman has expired. REP. GANSKE: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. REP. GREENWOOD: Before I go to the next -- before I recognize Mr. Markey for questions, I just want you to clarify something, Ms. Watkins. The Powers report indicated that you had not cooperated or had not participated in that investigation. Is that the case? MS. WATKINS: Well, not actually. They called me for the very first time December 13th and wanted to interview me the following week. I was actually a little surprised that it took them so long to -- REP. GREENWOOD: It took two months; is that right? MS. WATKINS: -- call me. Yes. REP. GREENWOOD: Any indication why it took them two months, since you were so central? MS. WATKINS: I had just hired Mr. Hilder. Enron was offering an attorney to represent me that was also representing Mr. Causey and Mr. Buy. I was not comfortable using that attorney. So I had spoken with Mr. Hilder. He was not up to speed yet on the issues. So we did meet with the special committee the week before Christmas, but just to say that we needed to reschedule. They indicated that they were trying to look at evidence first before they conducted interviews. REP. GREENWOOD: The chair recognizes the gentleman from Massachusetts, Mr. Markey, for 10 minutes. REP. ED MARKEY (D-MA): Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you, Ms. Watkins. Pinocchio had a conscience called Jiminy Cricket. Every time Pinocchio ignored Jiminy Cricket, his nose grew longer and longer. You were the conscience of this corporation. You warned them. And when they ignored your advice, they had to tell more lies. And the longer they told those lies, the more jeopardy that investors and employees of Enron were placed in. Now, what you have done is really very courageous. You\'re a hero. But being a whistleblower is something that can test the strength of the strongest person. It can buckle their knees. And I have a feeling that this is just the beginning of a process for you in terms of the stress that you\'re going to be under. I just want you to know that, for my part -- and I think I speak for every member of this committee -- that if actions that you feel are unwarranted are being taken against you because of what you\'re doing here, that you should let us know. They did the same thing to the Morton Thiacol whistleblowers that spoke of the O-ring. They demoted them. They punished them. But once Congress intervened, that was rectified within a day. So you should let us know that. Now, in both your August 15th and August 22nd letters to Mr. Lay, you warn that, quote, ""We do not have valuation issues"" -- I\'m sorry -- ""We do have valuation issues with our international assets, and possibly some of our Enron energy services mark-to-market positions."" Now, we know that Enron has created thousands of special-purpose entities. Do you believe that there may be some mark-to-market valuation problems involving transactions with any of these other special-purpose entities that were constructed? MS. WATKINS: I don\'t believe so. I mean, a number of the special-purpose entities that Enron has are somewhat routine. Enron did hire the best and the brightest, and a lot of them were structured so if we did want to sell an international power plant, we had a number of subsidiaries that might appeal to a European buyer, an Asian buyer. Some of them were very legitimate just to allow us all the options that we might want to pursue sometime in the future. REP. MARKEY: How about Enron\'s international assets? Do you think there could be some mark-to-market valuation problems there? MS. WATKINS: Not so much mark-to-market. But in accounting, if you have a long-term asset on your balance sheet that you feel is permanently impaired, you must write that down. And I believe there may be some problems with some of Enron\'s international assets. REP. MARKEY: How does that problem manifest itself? MS. WATKINS: If it appears that you will not achieve, over time, the value you have paid for a particular asset, you must write it down. So that would be an income statement impact, when you realize you\'ve got the valuation problems. REP. MARKEY: So, in other words, if they mark to the model and it turns out the model\'s not working -- MS. WATKINS: That\'s on our fair-value assets. REP. MARKEY: Right. MS. WATKINS: Most of the international assets were not necessarily fair-value assets. Those tended to be the domestic ones. So we do have some domestic assets that are fair value that are marked to a model that is somewhat subjective. REP. MARKEY: Okay. Now, Mr. Skilling has told us that he wasn\'t involved in the March 2001 Raptor transactions. The Powers Committee reports that others at Enron say he was. And Powers is critical of Mr. Skilling\'s failure to assure that the Raptor losses were properly accounted for in the first quarter of 2001. Do you have any knowledge of Mr. Skilling\'s involvement with or participation in the Raptor vehicles? MS. WATKINS: No, I do not. REP. MARKEY: You do not. Now, on October of 2000, Mr. Fastow convened a meeting of the LJM partners to review their activities. Mr. Skilling is listed as a guest speaker. On page seven of the presentation documentation for this meeting, Mr. Fastow says that the reason Enron needs private equity is because, quote, ""Energy and communications assets typically do not generate earnings or cash flow within the first one to three years, and investments dilute Enron\'s current earnings per share and its credit rating ratios."" Do you agree with that? MS. WATKINS: I mean, not all energy and communication assets don\'t generate cash flow, but I guess he means Enron\'s energy and communication assets were not generating cash flow. REP. MARKEY: Yes. Then you agree with that. MS. WATKINS: Yes. REP. MARKEY: Now, the proposed solution in that document was, quote, ""to deconsolidate assets"" and, quote, ""create structures which accelerate projected earnings and cash flows."" Now, you had run the JEDI partnership and had sold the Colombian asset to White Wing to increase cash flow. Would you agree that this was the purpose of Enron\'s SPE? MS. WATKINS: The purpose of the Condor SPE appeared, in my opinion, to be to generate funds flow. As far as LJM, I\'m mainly familiar just with Raptor and the Raptor special-purpose entities, and it does appear that those were created solely to ensure that certain losses that should flow through our income statement were masked. REP. MARKEY: All right, if you could turn to page nine, where it states that private equity can also be used for, quote, ""earnings generation."" You found that to be true on the Raptors\' SPEs, didn\'t you? MS. WATKINS: Yes. REP. MARKEY: You did. Now, Mr. Skilling told us under oath that while he was at Enron, he was not aware of, quote -- this is what he told the committee -- ""any financing arrangements designed to conceal liabilities or inflate profitability"" and that, again quote, ""the off- balance-sheet entities or SPEs that have gotten so much attention are commonplace in corporate America and, if properly established, they can effectively shift risk from a company\'s shareholders to others who have a different risk-reward preference. As a result, the financial statements issued by Enron, as far as I know"" -- this is Mr. Skilling speaking -- ""accurately reflected the financial condition of the company."" So, in your opinion, was Raptor IV, quote, ""a financing arrangement designed to conceal liabilities or inflate profitability""? MS. WATKINS: I would focus in on his comment that we did these deals to shift risk and return to an entity that wanted to bear that differing risk and return. So the risk-and-return scenario that Enron didn\'t want to bear transferred to a special-purpose entity. But we know from the Powers report that there was no real economic risk transferred to Raptor. REP. MARKEY: Do you believe that he knew the actual financial condition of the company? Mr. Skilling, that is. MS. WATKINS: Yes, I do. REP. MARKEY: You do. Here on the LJM2 approval sheet, we have Skilling signing off at tab two. Doesn\'t that mean to you that Mr. Skilling was involved in Raptor? MS. WATKINS: On these transactions, where he is signing off, he should be. I mean, I\'m looking at one that says, ""Jeff Skilling/Joe Sutton"" with no signature, but maybe it was -- oh. I don\'t know who that is (to find it?). I mean, if there was a signature block on these sheets, it had to be filled. REP. MARKEY: So that would be back on first, second -- page three -- fourth page. It says, ""LJM Approval Page 3,"" and the bottom is executive Jeff Skilling, with his signature next to it, March 12th, 2001. Can you see that? MS. WATKINS: March 12th, 2001. That\'s under tab 2? REP. MARKEY: Yes, it\'s under tab 2, page 3. MS. WATKINS: Yes. REP. MARKEY: Now, what does that indicate inside the corporate structure, as you know it, when a signature like that is under -- MS. WATKINS: Well, he is approving Raptor 4. And I am sure he was well versed with what this meant. REP. MARKEY: You\'re sure? MS. WATKINS: He typically was very well versed. REP. MARKEY: So in your opinion then at the very top of the company these men were well briefed with regard to what was going on inside these special purpose entities? MS. WATKINS: It would be my opinion that Mr. Skilling would be very well briefed about these transactions. REP. MARKEY: Well, again, I thank you. And, Mr. Chairman, I thank you for your courtesies in the last several years -- REP. GREENWOOD: I thank the gentleman -- REP. MARKEY: --and I thank you, Ms. Watkins, for your courage. REP. GREENWOOD: Before recognizing the gentleman from Texas, the chair is going to exercise the prerogative -- the chair has to turn the gavel over to someone else. But, Ms. Watkins, in your interview with V&E, you discussed that Fastow was in effect blackmailing banks to become investors in LJM. What did you mean by that? MS. WATKINS: I had heard from friends that worked at Chase and Credit Suisse and Bank of America that Andy was -- Mr. Fastow was almost somewhat threatening -- that if you didn\'t invest in LJM, Enron would not use you as a banker or an investment banker again, that he was threatening the institutions that to get Enron business they should invest in LJM. REP. GREENWOOD: Okay. Did t hat appear to be a successful strategy? MS. WATKINS: By the investors that are in LJM2, yes, it appeared to work. REP. GREENWOOD: How about Mr. McMahon? Was he -- he taught us about promises that were made to the banks. Was he -- did he participate in that ? MS. WATKINS: Well, I just remember from his testimony that he was asked about -- REP. GREENWOOD: Did you discus this issue with McMahon? MS. WATKINS: I -- he and I discussed that Mr. Fastow used strong-arm tactics occasionally. REP. GREENWOOD: The chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas, Mr. Green, for 10 minutes. REP. GREEN: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And, Ms. Watkins, if you\'ll -- I\'ll have some questions. But, first, I had somebody from Houston send me an e-mail -- well, it actually came from another member of Congress, and the young lady actually works in Houston. And she said this: Capitalism is if you have two cows and you sell one and you buy a bull and y our herd multiplies, and the economy grows, and you sell them to retire on the income. And now you have Enron capitalism. You have two cows -- you sell three of them to your publicly-listed company, using letters of credit opened by your brother-in-law at the bank; then execute a dead equity swap from an associate general officer, so you get all four cows backs with tax exemptions for five. The milk rights of the six cows are transferred via an intermediary to a Cayman Island company secretly owned by your CFO, who sells the rights to all seven cows back to your listed company. And the annual report says the company owns eight cows, with an option for six more. When I saw this late last night -- of course we ran until three o\'clock. And I thought, After hearing all the testimony that we\'ve heard before today, that\'s about what it sounds like. And your testimony is very refreshing in all honesty. And, like a lot of members, I respect you and admire you to be willing to put your job on the line, to go up to the CEO and say, you know, We have a problem. And after reading Vinson and Elkins\' response, they didn\'t respond like it should have been, and your testimony has already shown that. Let me turn if you could to tab 2 in your book -- and what it is is your memo that you sent to Mr. Hecker -- because our first hearing we actually had Arthur Andersen here and talked about your memo. Were you surprised? I know as a former Arthur Andersen how quickly Mr. Hecker communicated your concerns to Andersen\'s management? MS. WATKINS: Yes, I think -- I\'m looking at tab 16, and it\'s a memo from Mr. James Hecker, dated August 21st. I phoned him as he says -- REP. GREEN: Okay, yes, it\'s tab 2 on mine -- tab 16 on yours. MS. WATKINS: I phoned him, as it says -- more like a sounding board to talk to him about my concerns before I met with Mr. Lay. I -- you know, I was thinking it was just something between us. In hindsight I realize the severity of what I was concerned about was something that probably would induce him to do something about it. And I read this when this committee released this document a few weeks ago. REP. GREEN: And when you spoke with him and you told me you thought it would be confidential, or just between you and him? MS. WATKINS: Well, I didn\'t say confidential necessarily -- but I was just trying to run some things by him. And it -- I did not realize he had written a memo until this year. REP. GREEN: I guess in most organizations though if somebody brings something to my attention that impacts my company or partnership in this case, you know, I\'m -- I would expect him to be able to go to someone else and say, By the way, there\'s a problem that has been brought up, and it\'s my job to pass this on so somebody in a decision-making capacity higher than mine can do it. How long did you work with Arthur Andersen? MS. WATKINS: Eight years. REP. GREEN: Oh, so it was a number of years. And was it your experience that the practice groups tended to be sensitive about internal allegations of accounting irregularities during your eight years? MS. WATKINS: If I was still an auditor at Arthur Andersen and I got a call I guess like mine, I would be highly concerned with the conversation and the topics that I brought up with Mr. Hecker. So -- REP. GREEN: So, it would circulate in the office, and -- MS. WATKINS: I mean, it doesn\'t surprise me that he, that after reading this, he talked to the people that he did, and that he did try to bring a lot of attention to my concerns. REP. GREEN: And did you -- were you surprised that it actually made it all the way up to Chicago? MS. WATKINS: Not really. I mean, Mr. Hecker indicated to me during our call that he hoped I wasn\'t right, because he didn\'t think their firm could stand another scandal, following Waste Management and Sunbeam. REP. GREEN: Yeah, and we discussed that before at our hearings. I guess the Andersen folks who were here developed some type of ""I- don\'t-remember"" and ""I-don\'t-recall"" illnesses that it seems like people get when they come into our committee room. And when you worked at Arthur Andersen -- you know, I appreciate your insights in that, because on what\'s happened -- but it seemed like they weren\'t as forthcoming as maybe they should have been, having been notified last August. And maybe even questioned before your memo to Mr. Hecker. In most of your memos you almost always provided an additional list of people to speak with about collaborating your views. And you have been documenting, saying, This is just my opinion, but here\'s other folks that can collaborate. Are there people in the Enron food chain that -- who would be helpful to our subcommittee to talk to that maybe we haven\'t had the opportunity, or our investigators? Is there anyone that you know of that you may not have shared with our committee staff? MS. WATKINS: I think I\'ve mentioned most of the names to the staff, and also here today, that would be useful. REP. GREEN: Okay. Let me -- another question, and if you\'ll turn to page 37. Okay, I\'m sorry -- tab 26, the agenda for the LJM investments from October the 26th, 2000, annual partnership meeting. MS. WATKINS: Okay. REP. GREEN: I know that you haven\'t seen this document before, but I think you can shed some light on this for us. Now, on page 37 of this report, ""sample investments, Raptor 1."" Their first bullet points to, or reads in relevant part, that Raptor is structured, financed or capitalized with Enron stock derivative and LJM equity that will enter into derivative transactions with Enron related to investments in Enron\'s merchant investment portfolio. How can an entity that is capitalized with Enron stock derivatives legitimately enter into a derivative transaction with Enron? And how can Enron book that income from these transactions? MS. WATKINS: Well, the main issue too was that it was primarily capitalized with an Enron stock derivative, and the LJM equity had been completely offset by a cash fee paid to LJM. So under that structure, I don\'t see how it could have been legitimate. REP. GREEN: Okay. And, again, this is the annual partnership meeting of October of 2000. In your memo in August, and what we have seen from the Powers Report that there was even information in the spring of 2001 -- so you know it was before your memo. And now we have the original, the annual partnership meeting -- and I have to admit I was a business major, but I couldn\'t make heads or tails about how you could quantify this. I appreciate your answer. On page 38, ""sample investments, Osprey,"" the first bullet point reads, the relevant part, that Osprey is a partner and an investment vehicle that purchases merchant assets from Enron. It\'s capitalized with 50 million shares of Enron stock. If an entity were capitalized with Enron stock, and Enron sold assets to that entity, is Enron essentially selling assets to itself again? MS. WATKINS: This -- Osprey and Condor and Whitewing are all the same vehicle, and this is the Condor that I was referring to in my memos that I was uncomfortable with. REP. GREEN: So, to answer the question, if the entity were capitalized with Enron stock, and Enron sold assets to the entity, is Enron essentially selling assets to itself? MS. WATKINS: In this instance there were significant outside investors -- REP. GREEN: Okay. MS. WATKINS: -- and they could fall back on the assets for repayment. But it was also a structure that if the assets were not sufficient to repay the debt investors, they also had the stock. Supposedly this is a legitimate accounting structure. I\'m not happy with it. I think if there is a clawback (ph) to the company to its own stock it should not be off-balance-sheet. And the debt that came into Condor, or Whitewing, or Osprey, was used to purchase assets. And Enron got funds flow from operations treatment from that. And I think if it had been a consolidated special purpose entities it would have been funds flow from borrowings. And those are two very different funds flow items in terms of how an analyst would evaluate the company. REP. GREEN: The second bullet points out that this structure creates a synthetic multi-billion-dollar balance sheet for Enron that deconsolidated assets to generate funds flow. If in fact these structures created synthetic balance sheets for Enron that indicate an increase in funds flow, would this be intentionally deceptive to investors in your opinion? MS. WATKINS: Yes, in my opinion it would. REP. GREEN: Ms. Watkins, you said earlier that the push to sell assets and increase cash flow began in the third and fourth quarters of 1999? MS. WATKINS: Yes, sir. REP. GREEN: So now a year and a half later in its continued effort to artificially increase its cash flow, Enron is selling its assets at inflated prices to partnerships, of which its senior executives are the general partners. These partnerships are either capitalized with or guaranteed by Enron stock, and this was done to improve the optics of Enron\'s balance sheet in order to deceiving Wall Street analysts and investors? I know that\'s a long phrase, but do you think these -- in your opinion -- these partnerships were either capitalized or guaranteed this was done to improve the optics -- and I love the terminology -- the optics of the Enron balance sheets to deceive Wall Street analysts and investors? MS. WATKINS: It appears that some of these vehicles were used for financial statement manipulation. REP. GREEN: Okay. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Again, thank you for being here. And I have been proud to read the articles about a Texas lady who is willing to do that. REP. TAUZIN: I thank the gentleman. I think we have gone through the roster of members qualified to ask questions. I want to acknowledge for the record, however, the presence once again of Congresswoman Sheila Jackson Lee, who is not a member of our committee, and therefore not entitled to participate with questions, but who has been an extraordinary participant through all these hearing processes, on behalf of the citizens of her committee who have been so devastated by this collapse. And, again, Congresswoman Lee, we welcome you, and thank you for your attendance, and your participation physically, and I know emotionally in these hearings as well. Thank you. Let me before we wrap put a few questions into the record, Ms. Watkins, that I think are important as well because I think the answers will tell us a little bit about who was taking responsibility for what was going on and who was not. And I want to focus on the gentleman who held the position of executive vice president and chief risk officer. And would you describe for us the function of the chief risk officer in the corporation? MS. WATKINS: Mr. Buy supervised our credit department. REP. TAUZIN: And his name is Rick Buy, right? MS. WATKINS: Rick Buy, yes. He supervised our credit department, our risk assessment and control group, and he was in charge of our risk management policy that was presented to the board each year. REP. TAUZIN: So he was, according to our documents, responsible for identifying, quantifying, controlling the risk in both Enron\'s trading activities and their investment opportunities, right? MS. WATKINS: Yes. REP. TAUZIN: This would include all these special entities and partnerships that Enron was engaged in, right? MS. WATKINS: Yes, that\'s correct. REP. TAUZIN: Now, did you ever have a conversation with him about the precarious financial condition of Enron and its reliance upon these questionable deals to continue to meet the earnings projections? MS. WATKINS: I had worked with Mr. Buy during the time period where I was managing the JEDI portfolio. I have also had discussions with him -- you know, he was a former co-worker and friend. The week leading up to my meeting with Mr. Lay, Mr. Buy was on vacation, and I actually phoned him. I was trying to use him as a sounding board as well. I told him a bit about my concerns, and that I had a meeting scheduled with Mr. Lay. I asked him if I could fax him my materials to get his opinion of my concerns. REP. TAUZIN: Now, did you tell him that in fact some of the materials had come from his own shop? MS. WATKINS: No, but I just told him I had some memos that I wanted to fax him, and have him look at. REP. TAUZIN: Which -- did you identify those memos or explain to him what they might say or -- MS. WATKINS: I told him I was very concerned about the Raptor transactions, that we have very large accounting issues, and that it was not appropriate to be backstopping these Raptor losses with Enron stock. REP. TAUZIN: So you offered to send him all this. What was his response? MS. WATKINS: He said he\'d rather not see it. REP. TAUZIN: Now, he would rather not see it? And his job was the risk officer for the corporation? MS. WATKINS: Yes, sir. REP. TAUZIN: And so I suppose you didn\'t send it to him them? MS. WATKINS: No, I did not. REP. TAUZIN: So the chief risk officer of the corporation was sort of in a see no evil, hear no evil, speak no evil position? MS. WATKINS: It would appear so. REP. TAUZIN: He didn\'t want to see the documents? MS. WATKINS: It would appear that would be the case. REP. TAUZIN: Now, did he tell you anything about -- at any time -- about the precarious financial condition of Enron, and its reliance upon these deals? MS. WATKINS: Mr. Buy expressed the opinion to me, you know, as early as maybe even 1997-98, that he felt that Enron was one or two quarters away from disaster. Now, he had different reasons for that, but that was because we were a trading company. Trading companies usually -- it\'s hard to predict earnings. You have to depend upon volatility in the marketplace. And we were so dead-set on predicting our earnings, and the Street had become accustomed to us predicting our earnings -- so he just felt like if we ever missed our earnings targets people -- i.e., the analysts and the investing community -- would look at us with a -- under a microscope, so to speak, and that he was concerned that that would put us in, as he put it, in a disastrous position. REP. TAUZIN: So here is the chief risk officer, who has expressed to you concerns that you may be a quarter away from disaster because of your reliance, Enron\'s reliance upon these transactions, who says to you, Don\'t send to me the documents illustrating your concerns that there are serious problems with these transactions -- who did you react to that? MS. WATKINS: I was disappointed, because I felt like he was in a position to , you know, help us disclose these things with Mr. Lay. REP. TAUZIN: And you weren\'t getting any help at all from him? MS. WATKINS: Right. REP. TAUZIN: Now, you were part of an investor conference call on October 23rd. Now, to put it in perspective, this is about the time that you were discussing with Mr. Lay your concerns and bringing them to his attention? MS. WATKINS: Well, it was after the earnings release, which talked about the $1.2 billion shareholder reduction. REP. TAUZIN: October 16th, right? MS. WATKINS: October 16th. We had an October 23rd investor call that was open to the public, and I just listened in. REP. TAUZIN: Right. And now I understand that Mr. Causey and Mr. Lay were members of that conference call. MS. WATKINS: Yes, that\'s right. REP. TAUZIN: And you had a chance to listen in to the conversations. Was the Raptors discussed in that conference call? MS. WATKINS: Yes. An analyst asked the question: Okay, Enron has unwound these Raptor transactions, you\'ve written off the transactions in the third quarter of 2001; if they had never existed at all, what would have been the income statement impact for the year 2000? And Mr. Causey responded that there would have been little or not impact, because we could have done these transactions elsewhere. REP. TAUZIN: Was that a true statement? MS. WATKINS: I don\'t think so, and the Powers Report doesn\'t think so either. REP. TAUZIN: Did Mr. Lay have any comments on that point? MS. WATKINS: Well, Mr. Lay parroted Mr. Causey word for word, and I felt like that was a statement he didn\'t necessarily know, and it was unwise to parrot the chief accounting officer on that statement. REP. TAUZIN: Now, here Mr. Causey and Mr. Lay are in a conference call with investors, telling them that if the Raptors had not been a part of Enron, that there would have been no impact on the income statement. You believe that not to be true. Did you express your concerns about these statements following that conversation? MS. WATKINS: Well, I did go into Ms. Olson\'s office, and I said, You need to warn Mr. Lay that he should not make comments like that unless he knows it to be a fact. REP. TAUZIN: Did you make notes of those conversations? MS. WATKINS: Yes, I did. REP. TAUZIN: Have you supplied those notes to the committee? MS. WATKINS: I have them. I believe my attorney was going to supply them later. REP. TAUZIN: I would appreciate it if you would supply those notes, that we might have them as part of the record. And, without objection, that will be so ordered. One final thing I want to get on the record, Ms. Watkins, that I think is awfully important too. Once you were identified as the author of the anonymous letter you first sent, did any of the executive offices of Enron, the 50th floor up, ever contact you to discuss with you what you had written? Did anybody praise you for coming forward on the 50th floor? Was there a difference between the reaction of Enron employees below the 50th floor as opposed to those in charge on the 50th floor and above? MS. WATKINS: The reaction from the employees that have been laid off has been just fantastic. They are very supportive. And then I would say from 90 percent of the employees that are still there the reaction is also very positive. From the 50th floor, I have only had one person give me an ""atta girl,"" so to speak, and that was Mr. Ray Bowman. REP. TAUZIN: Now -- and one final thing -- this is very important obviously for you and for us. Will you agree to inform us immediately if as a result of your coming forward to testify before this committee, and your willingness to come forward to Mr. Lay with your concerns, as you have, if any retaliatory action is threatened, posed or suggested in terms of your employment and your position with Enron? MS. WATKINS: Yes, sir. REP. TAUZIN: All right. We thank you for that, and we assure you we will be watching that extraordinarily carefully. Are there any requests for additional questions? REP. DEUTSCH: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. REP. TAUZIN: The gentleman from Florida. REP. DEUTSCH: Just a couple of very specific follow-ups. In your discussion with staff yesterday, you stated that you believe that Enron should be taking additional write-offs beyond those in the November 8th restatement. Could you explain that? REP. TAUZIN: Well, the Raptor vehicles that I wrote about that were all associated with LJM 2 -- they were unwound and written off in the third quarter of 2001. And they have yet to be restated. Those should be unwound as if they never existed, and they should restate 2000 results in the first quarter of 2001. REP. DEUTSCH: What\'s the significance of taking additional write-offs, especially Enron is now in bankruptcy proceedings? MS. WATKINS: It\'s the appropriate thing to do for a public company. We are still publicly-traded and under SEC rules. REP. DEUTSCH: And just a couple of very quick follow-up questions. Is it your sense that there was complicity with the auditors, Arthur Andersen, and in a sense with Vinson and Elkins as well, or was there basically fraud to both your accountants and your attorneys? In other words, was this a cooperative effort with Enron management to basically come up with these ideas, or was the representation to the accountants and the attorneys misinformation? MS. WATKINS: It is my opinion that Enron transaction accountants -- most notably Ben Glisson, helped to come up with the structure and come up with a support for the structure, and then convinced Andersen that it worked. REP. DEUTSCH: So they knew -- what you are really saying is that in your opinion they knew it was not that Enron was holding back what the actual structure of the transaction was? MS. WATKINS: Oh, I think they understood the structure, yes. REP. DEUTSCH: And the issues in terms of Enron being the guarantor and all those issues? MS. WATKINS: Yes, yes. REP. DEUTSCH: You mentioned something obviously very disturbing, that you in fact felt for fear of your personal safety. Did you do anything to follow up based on that fear? MS. WATKINS: I did actually talk with some Enron security personnel. I was a little bit concerned that I had -- in effect Mr. Fastow potentially lost his job because, you know, I brought up these concerns. And I actually talked to Enron security personnel about whether I should do anything different -- more concerned that Mr. Fastow might be vindictive. REP. DEUTSCH: Did they give you any advice to take specific action? MS. WATKINS: Just general security advice on -- REP. DEUTSCH: Did Mr. Fastow exhibit any violent behavior or -- MS. WATKINS: No -- REP. DEUTSCH: -- erratic behavior that would -- MS. WATKINS: No, it\'s just I did not feel very much support. I did feel like I was a little bit of a lone fish swimming upstream. And so it starts to wear on you that it\'s you against them, and I was a little bit concerned. REP. DEUTSCH: Are you convinced that Mr. Baxter\'s death is a suicide, or was it possible that there was another more nefarious activity? MS. WATKINS: I\'m sure the authorities will have reported that correctly. REP. DEUTSCH: Is there any doubt in your mind? MS. WATKINS: Probably not. REP. DEUTSCH: Got in your mind about that it was a suicide? MS. WATKINS: Yes, I believe it probably was. REP. DEUTSCH: So if you say probably, there\'s doubt? MS. WATKINS: It\'s just a sensitive topic that I\'d rather not comment on. REP. DEUTSCH: Let me, for the last thing, submit for the record a list of transactions of Enron management. This is something we talked about previously. It\'s actually a list of transactions of sales of Enron stock through the end of last year, totally $1.1 billion -- REP. TAUZIN: Without objection, that will be part of the record. REP. DEUTSCH: -- a total of 17 million shares. You know, obviously none of these shares were sold at zero, at a dollar, at $5, at $10. And I guess these people were wise enough or lucky enough to sell stocks before the facts that you\'ve described and that we\'ve uncovered became public. And it\'s either they were all very lucky, or in fact they were trading on inside information, as it appears from the outside looking in. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. REP. TAUZIN: Thank you very much. I would also ask that the record include the transcript of the conference call referred to in our recent questions as part of the record, and without objection, it is so ordered. The gentleman Mr. Stupak is recognized for questions. REP. STUPAK: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And just a few questions, if I may. But before I do that, I want to thank you, Mr. Chairman, Mr. Dingell, Mr. Deutsch, Mr. Greenwood -- we have had about five or six hearings now. They\'ve been good hearings. We have all been working together on this debacle, if you will, and things have gone quite well. And I would also like to mention our personal staffs, but especially committee staff -- they\'ve worked long and hard to help get us prepared and worked -- I know I appreciate it, and everybody -- REP. TAUZIN: If the gentleman would yield -- REP. STUPAK: Sure I would. REP. TAUZIN: There\'s a personal interest story -- I know he\'s going to get upset with me for telling it, but the gentleman who is in charge of our investigative staff, Mark Paoletta (ph) here, just recently went through lung surgery -- serious lung surgery -- a surgery he was attempting to put off while this investigation was proceeding, and I had to threaten to fire him to make him in fact go to his follow-up, and threaten to fire him if he didn\'t go to the hospital and take care of his lung surgery. He took care of it this weekend, and you can see he\'s back to work already. The staff has done marvelous work, and Mr. Paoletta (ph) particularly accorded our appreciation for his sacrifice of self to get this job done, and we thank you, Mark. I thank the gentleman. REP. STUPAK: And we all appreciate Mark being back and helping throughout this whole ordeal that we have been going through. Ms. Watkins, something has been sort of bugging me, and I\'ve asked this question before, and never really got an answer -- maybe you can shed some light on it. In one of the transactions, Mr. Kopper in a very short period of time, made about $2 million, and the records and everything we have seen said there\'s no reason why he should make $2 million in about two months -- no indication of what was the consideration for the compensation. But yet he made that money, and I believe it was on the Southampton deal, and maybe it was the unwinding of Chewco or something like that. Any -- just how would someone get paid $2 million in this whole deal? I mean, how would you handle that on the books? MS. WATKINS: Well, all I know about those transactions were what I\'ve read in the Powers Report, and I would probably agree with the Powers Report that it does raise questions when you can have such large returns in such a short period of time. REP. STUPAK: Who -- what books handled that loss? The Enron books or Southampton? Would you know? MS. WATKINS: Well, if Enron was purchasing an interest, you know for instance a Chewco interest or whatever, if you are buying back an asset, that goes on your books at the price you paid. So it\'s not an income statement item. It\'s not necessarily a loss for Enron and a gain for Mr. Kopper. It could be an asset purchase by Enron that provided a gain to Mr. Kopper. REP. STUPAK: It sounds like just a way to pass through some money really quickly, right? In -- after you did your memo, and Vinson & Elkins reviewed -- did their investigation, if you will, on or about October 15th, they said that a broader investigation was not necessary and it was just bad cosmetics and we can see our way through that. But then the very next day, on October 16th, is when Enron announced that due to account errors and restructuring related to transactions involving LJM-II, it was revising the shareholder equity numbers downward by $1.2 billion and posting a third quarter loss in excess of $500 million. And, then it went on, and you didn\'t believe at that time, even in spite of the October 16th announcement, that the whole story had been told about the looming financial and accounting crisis involving all these partnerships and these PSEs (sic). And then on November 8th, Enron stated its intent to redo their financial statements for the past four years due to additional accounting problems, again with the LJM and Chewco partnership. Now, despite all these actions, October 15th and October 8th (sic), do you believe that we\'ve learned all the problems that are there, or is there still some things that you believe must be done to really come clean here with the American people and the stock and faith that people had in this company called Enron? MS. WATKINS: Well, I mean, the only people at Enron that are saying we have a problem is the people hired from the Powers report and myself. REP. STUPAK: So, despite all these restatement of accounting and restatement of financial statements, again, the Powers Report and you -- MS. WATKINS: Well, the Raptor transactions have not been restated yet. REP. STUPAK: So, what concerns would you still have then about the transparency or the accuracy of Enron\'s financial statements, beside the Raptor hasn\'t been fully restated? MS. WATKINS: Well, the Raptor transactions need to be fully restated, and -- REP. STUPAK: Anything else? MS. WATKINS: Well, if the -- there was another memo written by an employee from Enron Energy Services -- it was disclosed in the press. I think it outlined how Enron solved its EES mark-to-market valuation issues that I raised at the first part of my anonymous letter, and that needs to be looked at. That\'s segment reporting. I\'m sure they actually bore the loss in the wholesale group, but that segment reporting was important to Enron in 2001. REP. STUPAK: Well, it seems like the October 16th revaluation, if you will, was a result of your efforts. And it\'s our understanding between October 16th and November 8th there, you continued to push Ken Lay and others to do further restatements. So, maybe after your testimony today we can expect some more restatements from Enron, or some coming clean on Raptor or something like that -- hopefully, because we really want to get to the bottom of this. And what are all the problems here? Let\'s get it on the table. They\'re in the bankruptcy situation and we want to get this thing moved on. It brings me to my next question. In the minutes, and throughout some testimony and some of the flow charts we\'ve seen throughout here, there\'s mention of Enron Europe, the Southern Cone, which would be South America, Brazil, Australia, Japan. If we\'re seeing all these problems here in this country related to Enron, do you know of any problems that others are seeing overseas? What\'s happened over there in Australia? In Brazil, they were particularly concerned about the devaluation of their currency there and how it would affect Enron. So, the Enron collapse, how has it affected things overseas, if you know? MS. WATKINS: I\'m not -- I was in Enron international, but most of the international assets are hard assets. They\'re accrual-based assets. They\'re fairly tradition. In a country like Brazil that has devaluation concerns, it might mean that we don\'t achieve the U.S. dollar cash price that we paid, but I don\'t know of anything that would indicate any kind of financial statement manipulation related to those assets. REP. STUPAK: In -- I\'m looking at your memo. It\'s dated October 30th, 2001, 4:45. I\'m on the second page. It looks like it\'s tab number 21. And I\'m looking on the bottom of page two. It says ""Note."" Are you with me? MS. WATKINS: Yes. REP. STUPAK: Okay. It says ""Note. After restatement, the good news is that our core trading business is solid with strong numbers to report. The bad news, EBS was losing big money in 2000. The big losses didn\'t start until 2001 and EES did not start making a profit in 2000. So how would -- was the shareholders ever made aware of any of this? MS. WATKINS: My concern when I was making this point was that Enron Broadband and Enron Energy Services were our growth vehicles. They were supposedly one of the reasons why we were enjoying a high PE multiple. And we did finally report to investor that EBS was losing money, large amounts of money in 2001. But, the Raptor hedge on Evichi (sp) made EBS look like it had only lost 50 or 60 million in 2000 when actually it was more like 250 million. And, it was very important to Enron that we announce that Enron Energy Services was profitable in 2000. Without the new power hedges, EES was not profitable in 2000. This would have significantly impacted our PE (multiple ?) and our stock price in the year 2000. REP. STUPAK: So, it\'s fair to say, if you started losing money in 2000 and it really wasn\'t reported until 2001, so you probably have -- you have at least 12 months, so basically the shareholders weren\'t told the truth here of what was going on with this situation. Is that are fair statement? MS. WATKINS: That\'s a fair statement. REP. STUPAK: Okay. With that, Mr. Chairman, I have nothing further. Thank you. And thank you again. REP. TAUZIN: I thank you very much, Mr. Stupak. As we conclude, I note, Ms. Watkins, that on that same memo you make the point that Lay should meet with top SEC officials and that Ken Lay and Enron needed to support one of the SEC\'s long-term objectives requiring that the big five accounting firms rotate off their large clients on a regular basis as short as three years. Do you stand by that recommendation? MS. WATKINS: Yes, I do. I mean, as an investor in the U.S. stock market, I would feel a lot more comfortable knowing the public companies had to rotate their accounting firms every three years. REP. TAUZIN: It\'s a recommendation we received from a number of sources as we go forward. Let me make several observations -- first of all, that you sort of stumbled onto Raptors. You\'re not here saying that\'s all that may have been wrong. There may be other things in other transactions that you are not aware of that may need some inquiry, is that correct? MS. WATKINS: Yes sir. REP. TAUZIN: Secondly, that, as I said at the beginning of this hearing, we\'re going to try to move as rapidly as we can from this inquiry into an actual examination of solutions. And the committees are beginning to do that, and one of them met today, one of them met yesterday. And Mr. Greenwood and Mr. Stearns, in fact, have been asked by the committee to actually begin putting a set of recommendations together for the committee to look at. And your thoughts, as you have been asked before by some members in regards to your observations and recommended changes we might make are certainly welcome, and we would appreciate it. Ms. Watkins, your testimony stands for itself. It doesn\'t need a whole lot of elaboration by me or editorial comment, but I do want to make one. And that is that your testimony, your activities in regard to Enron actually call upon, I think, all of us to examine the notion of corporate loyalty. There is some, I assume who believe corporate loyalty is protecting the corporation against all harm, even when it\'s doing something wrong. You demonstrated for us a different definition of corporate loyalty, a different definition of fiduciary responsibility to a corporation. That includes responsibility to its shareholders and investors, and I want to compliment you for that. There are mothers and fathers listening to these hearings and who have heard your testimony and now have an experience, I think, upon which to hopefully teach their sons and daughters who are going to work for American corporations about the notion of corporate loyalty that you bring to the table this morning -- the notion that corporate loyalty means owning up to mistakes for the sake of the proper relationship to investors and consumers, and confronting them directly and reporting them and dealing with them forthrightly. Would that the last clear chance you gave the leadership of Enron been accepted and taken, apparently that didn\'t happen, but you at least stood for that proposition, and again I commend you for that. I hope that sons and daughters of American citizens follow your example, frankly, and adopt your concept of corporate loyalty as a mantra. As I said, we are learning from this hearings. I think corporate America is learning from these hearings. And I truly believe, as Mr. Greenwood does, that when we complete them -- and our work is not yet finished -- but when we complete them, we will, together -- Democrats and Republicans on this committee -- be able to propose a set of reforms, together with the reforms that I know that corporate America itself is talking about instituting, and agencies of our government are talking about instituting, that is going to build better, clearer, more responsible lines of communication and information and disclosure and investor confidence in this country. If that\'s a result of this mess, then perhaps our country will be much better for it in the end, and you will have contributed mightily to that process. For that I thank you. And unless there is any other business to come before the committee, the chair announces that the record will stay open for 30 days. Ms. Watkins, your testimony was under oath, of course, and if you and your attorney will carefully review it, and if there are any additional comments or clarifications or additions you want to make for the record, the record is open for 30 days. We may have additional questions we\'d like to submit to you in writing to which you might respond, we\'ll be in touch with you in that regard. Again, thank you for your extraordinary cooperation and for your contributions. The hearing stands adjourned.']"

BANCROFT was first introduced, and spoke as follows: Two years ago the purposes and acts of the rebellion forced the faithful citizens of the United States to rise in arms and prove that we are a people -- that we possess a country. Every hour of the long and terrible conflict has raised it in importance; the eyes of the whole civilized world rest upon us; the industrial classes of Europe bend toward us in sympathy and hope as to their champions; and the question is found to be not merely whether the United States shall be stricken from the family of nations, but whether the vital principles of freedom shall be preserved. [Applause.] The imperative call of duty cheers us on to the struggle more than ever; for unless we succeed, the power of the people which pervades all history as a prophecy, is beaten down, and there is no other Western hemisphere where the struggle can be renewed. We have no choice; we must persevere. If we would build up the home of humanity -- if we would safely transmit the regenerating principles that give life its value -- we must persevere. The result cannot be doubtful. The resources of the rebellion are nearly exhausted, while our own prosperity has hardly been impaired; we must press onward with united zeal, and ""win the victory of endurance born."" [Cheers.] We meet to-day without reference to party to pledge ourselves to one another for the vigorous prosecution of the war, until right shall triumph. But while we reserve to ourselves the utmost liberty of judgment both of men and measures, it is but an act of simple justice and historic truth to say that the rebellion found not even a plausible excuse in the Administration which last came into power. No sooner had the elections passed over than those who succeeded made every effort to allay excitement. A party had been formed that seemed pledged to prohibit the introduction of Slavery into the Territories, and yet the men of that party, after deliberations not in an unauthorized and insignificant Peace Congress, so called, but in the constitutional halls of legislation, joined in organizing the territories of the United States, without the restriction in the fundamental law of any one of them, leaving the event to the action of natural causes. A motion was even made and countenanced by intimate friends of the incoming President to bring a vast territory under the name of New-Mexico into the Union as an independent State, without any such restriction, and at a time when the municipal law of that Territory sustained Slavery with an extravagant hyperbole of intolerance. Nor were the friends of the present President wanting in giving assurances that his Administration would be as little marked by hostility to Slavery as if the Chair had been occupied by MADISON or HENRY CLAY. Moreover the Generals of the President\'s appointment were loud in professing their readiness in the midst of war, to pause in their career and assist in suppressing any possible rising of slaves. But yet, under all these circumstances, so infatuated was Slavery, that it still passionately pursued its purpose, and for the sake of founding a Confederacy on a basis on which no enduring Government can rest, aimed a blow that was intended to be fatal to the country and to the liberty of man. The war was, under every aspect, forced upon the Northern States; it was a war from which they could not escape. Had they proved cravens, they would have stood before the Powers of the earth of their own day, and before all succeeding generations, as men who betrayed their country and were recreant to Freedom itself. [Applause.] Our coming together on this occasion means that no exertion shall be wanting to annihilate the rebellion by the united and untiring exertion of the wealth and strength of the nation. It means that those who are in arms against our flag shall not at the same time receive at our hands the belligerent rights of alien enemies and the constitutional rights of citizens. It means that whoever may be at the head of our armies, the undivided sympathy of the country is to command unity in council and add vigor to every blow. [Applause.] It means that with one heart we entreat the President to disregard all considerations of so-called party necessities; to adopt no measures but for the public good; to turn a deaf ear to all selfish importunities of politicians of every party, and ever to remember that it would be a sin against the country, against his own happiness now, against his name with posterity, to lift an unfit man to office, in civil life or in the field. [Applause.] It means that all the generous feeling of the country goes forth to cheer on the noble statesmen of Missouri who are now struggling to shake off the terrible evil which alone holds at State back from one of the first places -- perhaps from the very first place in the Union -- for agriculture, mining, mechanical industry, for wealth and population. It means that our earnest sympathies embrace the freemen of the South, who, trained in the school of poverty, are now compelled by tyrannical power to fight for results that are in direct conflict with their own chances of happiness and advancement. It means that we are eager to go to the assistance of our friends in our mountain regions, and to give them security in the natural fastnesses of American freedom. Nor are we deterred from rendering a loyal support to the Government by the thought that the war in its results will weaken Slavery, or even work its overthrow. Civil war has always, in God\'s providence, been a means for rescuing men from bondage. Who is there to deplore the probable result that States where, in times past, labor has been despised, should come to own the true nobility of the working man, and restore the fields and the workshops to the free? Take Virginia, for an example. Her soil is fertile, her air salubrious; her springs renovate health; her mountains glisten with precious ores. There, in her many chambers, where nature has heaped-up stores of gold and silver, of gypsum and iron, of salt and copper, an evil spirit has cast over her its spell, and she sleeps in almost hopeless lethargy. Who will mourn if the time has come when her long and deep slumber shall be broken? Who will grieve if the procession of the Star Spangled Banner, borne onward to the songs of liberty, shall wake her from her trance of centuries? Then let her clothe her beautiful limbs in the robes of freedom and open her hundred halls to the hands of self-directed enterprise and skill. [Applause.] The present bitterness will pass away, and the next generation of her sons will meet ours in affection, and they will own that from this desperate strife has sprung the blessed regeneration of their lovely land. Nor is union required by our domestic affairs alone. There is reason to believe that here in New-York, men, falsely usurping the name of Democracy, have been willing to invite the interposition of the aristocracies of Europe. These men must be made to know that they stand alone. [Cheers and cries of ""Good.""] A nation which has always professed zeal for free trade, aims at a monopoly of the international carrying trade for themselves, by sending out ships built in their own shipyards, to prey upon our commerce. It is here in New-York more than in any place in our land, that the Government should be able to count with certainty upon a unanimous support in its efforts to maintain, against any foreign power, the rights and the dignity and interests of the country. [Applause.] So then the love of the Constitution, the love of liberty, the love of country, a proper sense of overhanging dangers, a just appreciation of our resources, conspire to demand the patriotic union of the people as our security at home and our only protection against wrongs from abroad."" [Applause.]']"

They had their favorites, but they put forth no claim that even one of them should be nominated. They were willing to take any one of the illustrious and distinguished statesmen of our party, except Mr. DOUGLAS. He had made himself obnoxious to them for the reasons already mentioned, and they asked that he should not be thrust down their throats. Was the request an unusual one? Our history as a party shows that it was not. Was the request an unreasonable one? Who will say so, when they reflect that upon the States which made it, chiefly devolved the task of electing the nominees of the Convention? Yet the Douglas delegates not only turned a deaf ear to this request, but in the most high handed and reckless manner, with sacrilegious hands, tore down the landmarks of the party, and trampled upon Democratic comity and usages, in order to foist that one man upon the Convention. With any other Democrat they could have had harmony and union, and presented to-day the spectacle of a united and invincible party. We put it to the conscience and the judgment of every honest man, are they not guilty of setting up this one man as paramount to the union of the States? Are they not guilty of having divided the party? Did they not take ""the first, fatal and irrevocable stride towards disunion of the States?"" From this unenviable position no ingenuity nor device, nor wholesale and reckless charges against others, can relieve them. ""Inexorable logic"" stamps the grave crime upon their brows. Representing States, nearly all of which were hopelessly Black Republican, they claimed that they were entitled to dictate both the platform and the candidates, and to this end the system of tactics, which we had witnessed outside of the Convention, was, for the first time in our history, (and we earnestly hope the last) steadily and persistently enacted in it. Rules were made and violated at pleasure. The decisions of an impartial President were adopted, and then overruled as it suited their purpose. The usages of Democratic Conventions were followed, and then shamefully violated, as it accorded with their designs. Everything was made to bend to the one great purpose for which they assembled -- the nomination of Mr. DOUGLAS. It cannot certainly be considered strange that honorable men, unused to such scenes, should leave the Convention, and that it was finally virtually broken up.']"

Confucian ideals of loyalty to family and friends and Protestant individualism, for example, may well suggest different notions of the good, and the pluralist holds that neither need be wrong. Because they value things differently, upholders of these different ways of life will sometimes not be able to agree to the liberal framework of rights. The devout may want a society in which blasphemy is a crime; the prudish may desire a society in which pornography is proscribed. For them, freedom of expression cannot extend to blasphemy or to smut. The defenders of free speech will reply that all are free to turn a deaf ear to offensive speech, or to exercise their own freedom to condemn it, but that restraining it offends against the rights of the pornographer. In such cases, Gray argues, we cannot guarantee that one view will be correct and the other mistaken. Value pluralism means there can be more than one way of being right. Gray's view, in effect, is that there is less of a consensus on moral matters across the various ways of life than liberal theorists suppose.

""Mima,"" and the leading light of other plays, including ""Kiki,"" ""The Harem"" and ""Lulu Belle,"" makes the talking-film bow at the Roxy in a ???erly staged melodrama with a background of Nuwuk and Nome in the days of the Klondike gold rush.Besides Miss Ulric there are capital performances by Ullrich Haupt and the redoubtable Louis Wolheim. The story itself is not blessed with a high degree of drama, but it has a number of imaginative moments that have been adroitly directed by Allan Dwan.Miss Ulric plays a half-caste, whose father was American and her mother an Eskimo. When with her Eskimo spouse, named Lanak, she is wild to get to the land of the white man and when she is in Nome she longs to return to her own igloo.This velvet-eyed wanton, known as Talu, is at first seen with her Eskimo companions, garbed in furs. Her costume is richer than any of the others and it is not long before her love of white women\'s finery is stressed. She steals away from Lanak, and boards Captain Jones\'s steamship. Jones, who is played by Mr. Haupt, who has a foreign accent, tempts Talu with gowns and soon Talu is perceived in a colorful frock.Duke, the first mate of the vessel, bemoans the captain\'s love of women. But his advice falls upon deaf ears and subsequently, when the ship is smashed to bits by the ice, Jones and Duke flee from Nuwuk in a sled, into which they throw Talu at the last moment. This happens after a parting shot has been fired at Lanak.The scene then changes to a livelier one, that of a gambling and dance hall in Nome. The women are clad in the old fashioned style. They pick the pockets of their dancing escorts, but they speak with bated breath about one of their number being caught smoking a cigarette.Mr. Dwan has introduced some effective comedy in the dance hall. In one sequence a woman sings a song of ""The Picture That Was Turned to the Wall,"" which inspires a French adventurer to warble a ""Bird in a Gilded Cage."" The effort so moves him that he bursts into tears. When he fails in the words he whistles, which provoked laughter among an audience yesterday afternoon.Talu becomes one of the dancing women. She is a fiery wench, who because she is a half-caste is heartily disliked by the other females.In the closing scenes Talu and Captain Jones are perceived once again dashing away in a dog sled from the angry Lanak, who has finally found his faithless wife. Jones has put a bullet through Duke and he hopes to escape Lanak\'s vengeance, but as the dogs run over the hard snow and ice they come to a break that widens into a canyon into which the sled and its occupants are hurled. This, like many of the other passages is expertly filmed. The backgrounds are for the most part impressive.Miss Ulric is splendid and she does not betray the slightest sign of microphone nervousness. Her half-caste accent leaves her after a spell in Nome, which is to be expected. The dialogue, written by Owen Davis, is sometimes a little forced in Miss Ulric\'s and some of the other rôles. Miss Ulric\'s acting, however, is compelling and her resourcefulness during silent passages is frequently in evidence.Mr. Rothafel prefaces this film with an ambitiously staged condensed version of ""Faust."" This offering is in eight scenes. Dorothy Githens appears as Marguerite, Harold von Duzee as Faust and Sigurd Nilssen as Mephisto.On the Movietone News Reel is the scene of President Hoover, Henry Ford and Thomas A. Edison, in Detroit, on the occasion of the celebration of the jubilee of the invention of the incandescent light.']"

Sixteen years ago, a letter of inquiry arrived from Robert M. Pirsig offering a book called ''Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance.'' The proposal was interesting enough to begin a four-year correspondence. ''What I didn't know then was that Bob had also written to other publishing houses at the same time,'' Mr. Landis said, amused. ''Six years passed between his first letter and our actual publication in 1974.'' Now a 10th anniversary edition is scheduled for April. To everyone's surprise, the book is still going strong - 100,000 copies a year in Morrow and Bantam editions. How come? Mr. Landis said, ''It had a great critical reception. But I'd say that you don't get a success like this without word-of- mouth.'' Even with that odd title? ''It's the original one, and I turned a deaf ear to any other. There was some raising of eyebrows but we stuck with it.'' The book has been variously interpreted. Some people have read it as fiction, others as autobiography. Mr. Landis says that basically it is ''a road story'' - a motorcyle ride taken by the author and his 11-year-old son, Chris, from Minnesota to the West Coast. Half the book is the trip; the other half is philosophy. ''It's about madness, reconcilation between father and son, and the crazy time of the 1960's,'' Mr. Landis said, ''but it touches a nerve for any time. I would add that the subtitle - 'An Inquiry Into Values' - is an accurate and useful description.''""]"

This adventure about a bad hombre who becomes less bad under the persuasive tutelage of a wistful tyke is tailored to their dimensions, being broad, loose, cute and improbable by turns. Mr. Beery has been in similar cinematic spots before and Metro\'s pint-sized performer has whispered similar soulful endearments before. Together they make ""Bad Bascomb"" a cheerful if somewhat lumbering and familiar Western.Its moments of excitement are few, but then Mr. Beery, as the leader of the Bascomb gang, which has terrorized the post-Civil War West, has time for a solitary and unsuccessful bank stick-up before he and his lieutenant are forced to seek aliases and sanctuary in a Mormon wagon train heading toward Utah. This, then, is hardly the scene for protracted battles and Mr. Beery spends more time being the homespun confidant of Margaret O\'Brien than in derringdo against the Indians. In the course of the trek, however, the shooting irons do come out of the holsters occasionally and the resulting fireworks and fights are a treat and the carnage among the Red Men appropriate.If Mr. Beery turns noble, finally saving the wagon train and surrendering to the inexorable law, it is only because he has turned a deaf ear to the villainous suggestions of his outlaw sidekick, J. Carrol Naish, while heeding the blandishments of Margaret and the loving but acid harangues of her grandmother, Marjorie Main. Mr. Naish is properly sneaking as the renegade, and deserves all the hisses he\'ll get, while Frances Rafferty and Marshall Thompson are adequate in the slim romantic roles.

Action only -- not words -- can meet the present alarming crisis. Prompt, immediate action is required by those who have done wrong. Who, then, are the wrong-doers? And from what causes have the wrongs proceeded? Let us ascertain the nature of the evil which has worked the mischief, and then let the remedy be applied. We are not here for the purpose of recrimination or accusation. We do not doubt that a large proportion of our Northern brethren neither intended nor desired to wrong the South. They have acted under a delusion -- an awful mistake. They have been artfully led on by demagogues to the brink of that gulf from which we hone they will now recoil with dismay. The fanatics of New-England have deduced from the Declaration of Independence the corollary that as all men are created equal there can be no such thing as property in man -- of course that Slavery is wrong -- a crime, a sin, and ought to be abolished. They confounded the property which the master has in the services of the slave, with the -- property in man. The relation of matter and slave gives the master only a property in the services of the slave. He cannot lawfully maim, abuse, or kill his slave; he cannot lawfully treat him as a brute animal. Fanaticism draws none of these distinctions, but deludes itself with the idea that there is crime in the ownership the law gives the master in the services of his slave. What the law makes property is property. What the law declares to be right is right. There is no safety, no stability, no security in civil society except in absolute obedience to the laws of the country. To deny this supremacy of the law is revolutionary, incendiary, seditious, and armed resistance to it is treason. But owing to the influence of these fallacies, we are now on the verge of civil war. We know that some of those identified with Anti-Slavery agitation declare that they intended no harm; they do not mean abolition. We shall not discuss what is the legitimate deduction from the proclamation of the ""Irrepressible Conflict"" or the ""Process of Extinction."" It is taken for granted by the South that those men mean what they say. Hence they stand to their arms, and demand, not indemnity for the past, but security for the future. Let the fallacies of Anti-Slavery agitators be repudiated. Let the same fraternal relations be restored which existed between the North and the South in the days of WASHINGTON and JEFFERSON. Let the citizen of the South, when he visits the North, bring with him his domestics, and enjoy their services as formerly, during his temporary visit of business or pleasure. Let the fugitive from service be, in the words of the Constitution, delivered up on claim; and wherever this should not be done, let certain and sufficient indemnity be provided. Accord to the South all the rights of property guaranteed by the Constitution and the laws and the decisions of the Supreme Court, in pursuance thereof. Let the nullifying Personal Liberty bills of the Northern States be repealed. All this the South has a clear right under the Constitution to demand. Now, will the North refuse to do this simple act of justice to the South? or will the North prefer blood to the renunciation of these illegal and unfortunate acts? Fellow-citizens, something must be done. Words will not do it. Words will not avert the catastrophe. Action is necessary. The North is wrong, as the matter now stands. The North has done wrong. What has been wrongly done must be undone. We earnestly hope, nay, we would supplicate the North, to put herself right before she comes to the arbitrament of the sword. Men of the North, get back to your true position, and then, and not until then, can we speak in tones of thunder against all rebellion. Let everything in the way of legislation at the North, which has been produced by the fallacies of Anti-Slavery, be done away. But it must be done without delay. The danger is that the South will not wait. Here is the danger, and we are now confronted by the awful imminence of a broken and dismembered Union, ""of a land rent by civil discord and drenched with fraternal blood."" Will not the North recede from its false position? Will they prefer the fate of the Jacobins and infidels who drenched the streets of Paris with the blood of their fellow-citizens during the reign of DANTON and MARAT and ROBESPIERRE? Let no one suppose that revolution and civil war can be separated. You cannot divorce effects from causes. History tells us that the authors of revolution seldom survive its horrors. Listen to no concession, refuse justice, turn a deaf ear to the demands of the Constitution, and take heed that when revolution is accomplished, you who have sown the wind do not reap the whirlwind. A reaction will commence"". You will be held to a bloody responsibility. The howl of famished free-labor upon which you will have brought destitution and misery, will track your guilty steps even to the palace fireside of your capitalists, and if the streets of your cities do not run led with gore, it will be because the vengeance of the masses will be appeased with the execution of those who have produced the mischief. On one side, then, is presented to the North the concession of what is right, a willingness to perform the terms of the original bargain, compromise, concession, which only requires the exercise of a just magnanimity, the abandonment of vain fallacies and visionary speculations. On the other side dissolution of the Union and civil war. The small States, in the event of a dissolution of the Union, would occupy a position of great danger. And they ought to consent, and doubtless would if necessary consent, to any proper amendment of the Constitution which would prevent that most terrible of all evils to them, the dismemberment of the Union. The Union was originally made more perfect by the exercise of concession, conciliation and compromise, and may be preserved forever by adherence to good faith, justice and patriotism. Let us forget all past differences. Let us cease to remember that we have belonged to different political parties, and address ourselves to the work of preserving the Union. Let us here, on this battle-field of the Revolutionary war, send forth to our brethren in the North an invocation to abandon the policy that has jeopardized the peace and fraternity of the Union; and to our Southern brethren an earnest supplication to wait -- not to act hastily -- and a fraternal admonition that it will be an easy thing to destroy the Union -- which may be done at any time -- but to remodel and reconstruct it will be difficult, and the work of ages.']"

We called for a London meeting As the market was explosive, And said, ''Dear members, The solution must be comprehensive, To restitute the market's health, The strength is now imperative, Let production have a ceiling, Since luck is surely offensive.'' To each a share in the market, And let supplies be divided, And as reduction of the price Cannot by now be avoided, Let us arise and all declare: ''A new measure is decided, Lest we lose these markets we seek, ''And feel disturbed or derided.'' What we have said all ministers Well understand and know, Yet implementing is difficult When predilections show, That each pities himself and feels Struck by an unjust blow. With Dikko* we have all pleaded Saying: ''You are now committed ''To raise your price by one dollar, ''Or else we all stand to suffer.'' Yet all our pleas he rejected, And claimed the issue had been settled. He could only reiterate What his government had asserted. ''Even by half a dollar,'' we cried, And East and West roared with the same. But he again, to our great shame, Turned a deaf ear. ''If you must blame, ''Do so!'' he said. ''But then prices ''Must float according to this game.'' Oh, will reproach convert, you think? My friend, you are misled! We have greatly argued, until Our tongues became heavy as lead. When things seem depressing, ill omens loom, And we sink into great anguish. But when they brighten up, as with a boom, All our troubles seem to vanish. How many committees have we all had When differences were so rampant, But when the germ causing disease is fed, Futile is all predicament. The price of oil is falling down. Reduction does now look inevitable. So let us discuss clear quotas Though discussions may seem impossible, The least of evils seems the best, Thus choice rests with what is acceptable.

A Spanish island, the first of which the great Columbus took possession -- an island which was the object of the especial predilection of that great Queen who, in a manner, divined the existence of a new world -- has just invoked, in the plenitude of its independence, the name of Spain, and has laid at the foot of the throne that same sovereignty which your Majesty deigned to recognize in it some years ago. In those days of public calamity the Dominican people implored the assistance of Spain. Descendants of that heroic nation, animated with the same spirit, speaking the same language, holding the same faith, this people has always loved Spain, from whom alone it could hope to secure that peace and prosperity which some of her children had sought, but in vain, from an imaginary and factitious independence. Spain, on her side, could not look with indifference on the fate of the Dominican people. She sympathized with their sufferings, and would fain have relieved them; but it was her bounden duty to give no ground for unjust and angry accusations. Spain is great, and has no need to extend her frontiers to occupy a distinguished rank among the first nations of the world. But if such were her desire, she would never have recourse to means which morality and sound policy equally condemn, because there is nothing durable but what is based on right and justice. The proclamation of your Majesty throughout the Dominican territory has proved the spontaneousness and unanimity which attend the expression of the national will. It has not caused a single tear or a moment's uneasiness, but was everywhere hailed with unfeigned joy and enthusiasm. Already the Spanish flag was flying under that sky to which the immortal COLUMBUS had borne it, with the Gospel in his hand; and where he planted that civilization, the most glorious of all then known. It was the duty of the sea and land forces of Spain to defend and protect the independence of the Dominican people, and to insure the integrity of its territory. These troops did not take possession of the territory in the name of your Majesty, Such an act, performed without the assent of your Government, would have tarnished the reputation enjoyed by that army for discipline, courage and loyalty. To reject the prayer of an unhappy people, to expose it as a prey to foreign ambitions, to turn a deaf ear to the cry for union uttered by a whole nation, which has ever loved Spain, would be abjuring the glorious traditions of our history; would be, in fact, an act of treason to our chivalrous and loyal character. No, Madame, it is impossible to reject the prayer of a whole nation imploring admission to the bosom of its mother country, from which it has been so long severed. Whatever the duties which the reincorporation of St. Domingo with Spain may impose on the monarchy, on your Majesty, and your Government, all Spain will not fail to fulfill them. Happily, there is no necessity for any change in the social state. The inhabitants are free. Slavery, the inevitable evil of the other colonies, is altogether unnecessary for the cultivation of that fertile territory, and your Majesty's Government can never think of reestablishing it there. The Dominicans, obedient to the voice of authority, will joyfully accept the administrative organization which your Majesty's Government shall think proper to establish among them. All will equally enjoy the beneficent protection of your Majesty. Before the august throne which your Majesty so gloriously fills all categories disappear, all party hatreds die away, and nothing remains but a mother jealous of assuring happiness and peace among her children. Your Majesty, ever anxious to secure those blessings for her people, and who bas so greatly contributed to its glorious regeneration, will display towards St. Domingo the same interest and the same solicitude as towards the other provinces of the monarchy. The Council of Ministers has, therefore, the honor of submitting for your Majesty's approbation the following draught of a decree:""]"

His idea was that it was the policy of this State to preserve the old government.

The question of slavery in the territories, and the promises of the demagogues, and their action in the premises, had involved us in the war. Their action had resulted in the removal of the institution. It is gone, and, so far as I am concerned, I acquiesce in the decision. They promised us also -- and in truth, as honest men, they were bound to comply with that promise -- that no partisan feeling should exhibit itself in the administration of the new government; but unless a man belonged to the original secession school he was marked and proscribed.

He has hounded on this war, year after year, turning a deaf ear to the citizens. He knew that it was useless; as a man of ordinary sense he must have known it; but he had not perfected his schemes of plunder. He waited for the last cent, and the trinkets and silver and gold of the misguided women and children of the South, until he could put his hands on our specie. He has not only amassed all that wealth, but has sent bill after bill of sterling exchange across the waters, for his benefit and BENJAMIN\'s, and has departed from Richmond precipitately.

They were aware of the intrigues of the Empress. They knew that LA GUERRONIERE\'s reactionary journal, La France, was subventioned and directly inspired by her. They apprehended, perhaps, that the Emperor\'s lingering doubts and scruples and his unwillingness to offend the clergy by any appearance of harsh dealing with the Pope, might breed difficulty of detail and further delay; but they were one and all under the impression that the Emperor had been brought to recognize the evacuation of Rome as a great State necessity, and that a step would at once be taken toward the realization of the admitted principle. What then was their surprise, when, at the first Ministerial Council held at St. Cloud, after the Emperor\'s return from Biarritz, M. THOUVENEL, the moment he began to talk about Rome, was interrupted by the Emperor, who, twirling his moustache, said quietly, that inasmuch as he had made up his mind to maintain the status quo at Rome, it was useless to waste any time in discussing the subject. Nothing more was said at the moment, and the Council proceeded to discuss financial and commercial matters. But the next day the leading Ministers met together, and resolved that they had been befooled and deluded by their Imperial master to such an extent that it was impossible for them, with any decent regard to their personal dignity, to continue in office. They had successively individual interviews with the Emperor to remonstrate with him, but without success, and on Tuesday last, five Ministers at least, M.M. FOULD, THOUVENEL, DE PERSIGNY, ROUHER, and another (whose name I do not at this instant remember) tendered their joint and several resignations. The Emperor, without yielding a peg, made an appeal to their loyalty and devotion to his person, not to resign all in a lump, on account of the scandal, and above all, of the panic at the Bourse, which such a collective step would occasion. They had not sufficient firmness to turn a deaf ear to such a supplication, from such a quarter; and although my personal opinion is that the truer patriotism would have been to have persevered at any cost, yet I cannot but make every allowance for M. FOULD when I know that his resignation, under the circumstances, would have caused a fall of two or three per cent in the public funds.

The arts need the cities, and the cities need the arts—that is a fudamental fact of our cultural life, and it ought to be the cornerstone of any national arts policy. It is a fact that President Ford, despite his “conversion” to the arts, managed to overlook when he turned a deaf ear to New York's fiscall crisis, and Mr. Carter's talk of “de‐centralizing” the arts likewise betrays an indifference to it. If it is the growth of American culture we are concerned with, and not merely its packaging and distribution, then it is to the dynamic artistic life of the cities that money must flow in larger and larger quantities. Only then will we be assured of having something worthwhile — something more than a cultural sop—to send to that remote coustry crossroads.

California\'s recent earthquake proved less cooperative. As the estimate for claims rose to $6 billion, insurers knew things would have to change. Now the shape of those changes is coming into focus: higher premiums, tougher guidelines and more companies simply wanting nothing to do with it -- ""a crisis in the making"" was one description. So just as many Californians have been jolted into seeking earthquake insurance, insurers are saying, No, there must be some other way -- like a Federal program to ease the pain. Miracle on 59th Street? What a difference a decade makes. In 1985 Mortimer Zuckerman agreed to pay $455 million to build a huge edifice on the New York Coliseum site. Last week, after endless wrangling, he agreed to buy just half the site from the M.T.A. The price? A mere $80 million -- plus $20 million the city will chip in -- for a prime piece of real estate (Columbus may be out of favor, but Columbus Circle certainly isn\'t). Of course, The Daily News, also owned by Mr. Zuckerman, endorsed Mayor Giuliani in November, and the Giuliani administration has pushed hard for a Coliseum deal, leading critics to see some mutual back-scratching. ""Scurrilous attacks,"" said the Mayor. ""We have viewed this on the merits."" Kudlow, Back in the Game In the where-are-they-now vein, it should be noted that Lawrence Kudlow\'s exile from the brokerage world ended last week. Mr. Kudlow resigned in March as chief economist at Bear, Stearns, later acknowledging that he had a drug and alcohol problem. Soon after, he was named economics editor at National Review, at what could generously be described as a fraction of his former salary. And last week he stuck his toe back in Wall Street\'s waters by signing on as a very part-time consultant to Montgomery Securities. Asked about past problems, a Montgomery official said, ""To the best of our knowledge he is cured."" Now Hoffenberg Wants a Deal Steven Hoffenberg has apparently decided the Government has a mighty fortress of evidence against him. In February authorities scrapped a plea agreement with him, saying he had not met its terms. But last week it appeared that Mr. Hoffenberg wanted another chance at it. He\'s accused of using Towers Financial to defraud investors of hundreds of millions of dollars, and if convicted he\'d face up to 25 years in prison. So a much lighter sentence clearly looks far better to him. INTERNATIONAL A Saudi Bet on Euro Disney Citicorp and Euro Disney would seem to have nothing in common, but they\'ve managed to find the same well-heeled friend. A few years back, Prince Walid bin Talal of Saudi Arabia saw a rosy future for the giant bank, invested $800 million and reaped a huge profit after Citicorp\'s fortunes rebounded. Now Prince Walid thinks he\'s found another lost soul waiting for his touch: Last week he agreed to invest up to $500 million in Euro Disney, whose fortunes have gone from bad to dismal. So those who have written off the French theme park as a culturally tone-deaf blunder may have to pause and weigh the possibility that one Saudi -- when it\'s this one -- can\'t be wrong. Don\'t Count Japan Out Don\'t write off the Japanese economy just yet. The nation\'s been stuck in recession for years, with each glimmer of hope quickly wilting. But a few crocuses have been pushing through lately, and this time they just might prove a prelude to spring. Last week several indicators pointed in a rare positive direction, and the Tokyo stock market has been plowing ahead -- it\'s up 20 percent this year and could soon hit a two-year high. One key factor: a strong yen has hurt badly, but now that the United States is starting to worry about a weak dollar, that could change. COMPANIES Cable TV, Alive and Well The reports of cable television\'s death by regulatory strangulation were premature. Last week Cox agreed to buy Times Mirror\'s cable operations for a hefty $2.3 billion, to create the nation\'s No. 3 cable company. Cable stocks rallied, roused from the stupor brought on by the collapse of other deals this year. Left Hand Clasps Right It worked like this, Florida officials say: In the 80\'s, Humana owned both hospitals and health plans, and the left hand (health plans) negotiated big, secret discounts from the right (hospitals). But patients, they assert, saw no discounts. A patient paid, say, $200, thinking it was 20 percent of a $1,000 hospital bill. But the true bill was often far less -- possibly even less than $200, meaning the patient paid the whole thing. Humana admits no wrongdoing, but last week it agreed to pay $6.2 million, to 37,000 Florida customers, to settle the case. It had already gotten out of the hospital business; its hospitals are now part of Columbia/HCA Healthcare. Pick a Number at IDB Reporting earnings is not always the most precise of sciences; many numbers can have a variety of spins put on them. But there are limits, and Deloitte & Touche says IDB Communications went past them. Deloitte resigned recently as IDB\'s auditors, citing ""questions concerning its ability to rely on management\'s representations""; when that news broke last week, IDB\'s share price was sliced in half. IDB, it seems, announced first-quarter results even after Deloitte raised a flag, then made changes that added $5 million to revenues but left profits unchanged. IDB says it could document the changes, but Deloitte quit before it could do so. So do top IDB executives have undying faith in their company? Well, three of them sold millions of dollars in stock in the last year. When Leased Cars Pile Up Leasing has taken off, and car makers love it: they can move those new models quickly. Now that golden egg is coming home to hatch, and what\'s popping out is more used cars than dealers can handle. But many buyers hear ""used car"" and think, ""What if it\'s a lemon?"" What to do? Cadillac was one that badly needed an answer, because it now leases half its new cars, up from 22 percent in 1991. So Cadillac\'s latest answer is to make used cars less threatening by extending warranties -- from four years or 50,000 miles to six or 70,000. Now G.M. must certainly hope it isn\'t the one stuck with lemons. At Bell Labs, Just Science AT&T Bell Labs is known for sticking to science, for calling a chip a chip -- and damn the political torpedoes. Last week it gave a vivid display of independence, as a Bell Labs scientist disclosed that he\'d discovered a flaw in AT&T\'s ""Clipper"" chip, which has been billed as a device that would allow authorities to eavesdrop on coded computer transmissions. The trouble is, AT&T was envisioning a multimillion-dollar business in these chips -- especially if the Administration makes the technology a national standard -- and this could throw a wrench into that plan. So there was some internal soul-searching about disclosure, but the truth came out. (Mixed) Smoke Signals The group is called Californians for Statewide Smoking Restrictions. You\'d be excused for guessing that it\'s pushing for, well, more smoking restrictions. Wrong. Put together by Philip Morris, the group backs a measure that would actually weaken many local anti-smoking laws by replacing them with a softer statewide law. And last week, state election officials cried foul at the way the group got people to sign a petition to get the measure on the ballot, charging that its canvassers identified themselves as people seeking to ban smoking, mischaracterized the petition and did not disclose that Philip Morris was backing it. The group\'s response: the accusation is obviously ""politically motivated.""']"

First of all, a superb ear (unequalled, I think, in the work of any poet now writing in English) for stately measure, cadences of a slow, processional grandeur, and rich, ceremonial orchestration. His ''musicianship'' is so fine and conspicuous a kind that it has often been ignored, and sometimes even mocked by those who are militantly tone-deaf. Next, a philosophic bent and a religious temper, which are by no means the same thing, but which here consort comfortably together. Wit, polish, a formal elegance that is never haughty or condescending, though, again, by those unimpressed by or envious of his skills it is taken for a chilling frigidity. And an unfeigned gusto, a naturally happy and grateful response to the physical beauty of the world, of women, of works of art, landscapes, weather, and the perceiving, constructing mind that tries to know them. But in a way I think most characteristic of all, his is the most kinetic poetry I know: verbs are among his decisively important tools, and his poetry is everywhere a vision of action, of motion and performance. The Frenzy of Renown To be ''celebrated for being oneself,'' says Leo Braudy, is the purest kind of fame. But in ''The Frenzy of Renown'' (Oxford), he shows how fame can fix or freeze the self in ''a static perfection.''""]"
